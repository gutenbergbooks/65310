<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“Old</span> age will be served,” said Mrs. Carteret grimly.
“But I suppose you think I am a long time dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita made a face in the heavy shade of the bed-hangings,
but replied politely: “I am glad to be here,
grandmother, and when it’s my turn to die I’ll take all
the time I choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a crisp clear voice and a staccato delivery,
which she made no attempt to modify in the sick-room,
and the old lady frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never cared for your mother, but she had a soft
low voice, ‘an excellent thing in woman.’ Why did you
not model your own upon it? And you do all you can to
distort and destroy the Carteret beauty in your attempt
to look like a boy. The Carteret women were all dashing
brunettes, but feminine. Otherwise they never would
have had men crawling at their feet, generation after
generation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If men crawled at my feet—which they don’t do these
days, anyhow—I’d kick them out of the way. And if
I were a man myself—and I wish to God I were—I’d
see women to the devil before I’d make a fool of myself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like your language. I don’t like your voice.
I don’t like your bobbed hair——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My hair is not bobbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad enough whatever it is. I don’t like your ‘brooding
brows,’ to quote an expression I read in a silly novel.
I don’t like your boyish defiant bearing; it is not ladylike.
I don’t like your ugly tailored suits—I’ve never
seen you with a single feminine adornment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never will. Haven’t I told you I hate—loathe—being
a female?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks. I don’t pretend to know what bee you’ve
got in your bonnet, but if you’ll take my advice you’ll
pluck it out before it’s too late——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not in my bonnet. It’s inside my skull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t interrupt me. You’ve no manners.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
you’re a Carteret all the same, in spite of your ridiculous
airs and notions, and you look—could look—exactly as
I did in my youth: I was your grandfather’s second
cousin and a Carteret to my finger-tips—except that you
are not tall enough. I was five-feet-eight and you must
be quite three inches shorter. I was the beauty and the
belle of my day, and that is more than you will ever
be unless you take heed before it is too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray old voice, with its sudden moments of
vehement life, trailed off and her gaze turned inward.
The light from the open window shone on her face high
on the pillows in the ancient four-post bed, and Gita
looked at it with the cold appraisement of youth. Beautiful?
Once, perhaps. The black eyes were still keen
and bright, although sunken deep in sockets as yellow
and crinkled as an old Asiatic’s. The bony ridge of the
nose was high and thin, but the cheeks were seamed with
a thousand little wrinkles and the mouth was a pale
satiric line. She looked more like an old bird of prey
than the remnants of a woman, and Gita decided it was
not worth the mental effort to repad that face with firm
young flesh and give it the pedestal of a swan-like neck
or any of the other absurdities of archaic youth. She
looked longingly through the window at the sunlight,
but she had made up her mind to “do the decent thing”
as the old lady had rescued her from poverty and heaven
knew what not. Besides, she admitted grudgingly, blood
was blood, and her grandmother had no one else. Noblesse
oblige. Moreover, she rather liked this new-found relative,
with her sharp, sarcastic, if superannuated, mind.
If she had been affectionate life would have been unendurable
once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Carteret Manor was not far from the island
covered by Atlantic City, and behind the Old Shore
Road. It was surrounded on three sides by pine woods
but open to the sea on the east. There had been a
storm the night before and from this high window Gita
could see the tossing spray that hid the horizon. She
forgot her grandmother until the old lady spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They named you Gita, anyhow!” she said triumphantly.
“The first daughter of every son was always
named Gita, but it would have been like your father
to break the tradition, especially as your mother disliked
me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There have been many Gita Carterets! And
you are a Carteret through and through. Not a trace
of your mother, thank heaven——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t hear a word against my mother! My mother
was an angel and a martyr, and as for my father—I don’t
care if he was your son——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a scallywag. I’ll not deny it. Many of the
Carteret men were. My sympathies were with your
mother although I liked her as little as she liked me.
She was no wife for Gerald—I told her so—but for that
matter only a Carteret could handle a Carteret. Nevertheless,
young lady, it behooves a child to speak of its
parents with respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Carteret gave an unladylike snort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes! And there is one thing you have <span class='it'>not</span> inherited,
and that is the Carteret grand manner. Even
your father had that, and when he was most intoxicated.
You have neither manner nor manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both are out of date.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they? I am not so sure. The world is not entirely
composed of what you call the younger generation. Are
you a specimen of the flappers all these magazines and
novels are full of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not. Silly little <span class='it'>females</span>. Besides, I’m twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make out whether you seem to hate men or
women more, and you won’t give any reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t hate women. I only resent being one. If
you had been my old grandfather I’d have starved in the
streets before I’d have come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a wonder, with your remarkable freedom of
speech, you don’t say you would have gone on the
streets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never! I’d have died a thousand deaths first.
Not,” she added hurriedly, “because I’d have been too
good for it, but because—well, I’d have killed the first
man that touched me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you are virtuous,” said the old lady complacently.
“All the Carteret women have been. Flirts
and coquettes, perhaps——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Virtuous nothing. I don’t care a damn——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not a boy, after all, so kindly refrain from
swearing in my presence. The Carteret men swore like
troopers, but their women never forgot themselves. And
please remember that I am helpless. I cannot rise and
leave the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, grandmother. I’ll not do it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a good heart, anyhow——No, you needn’t
snort. It’s a hideous noise, and a good heart is no disgrace
in even a modern young woman. I like you in
spite of everything, and I wish I could have had the
bringing-up of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God you had!” the girl exclaimed with unexpected
passion. “I wish my mother could have died
when I was born, or at least too young to remember anything,
and that my father had brought me to you and
then blown out his cruel brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do not. There are some words I dislike exceedingly
and ‘suicide’ is one of them. And I despise
cowards.” (“Old cliché,” muttered Gita.) “That is
another thing in you that pleases me. You have a high
courage. All the Carterets had that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One more reason for being a Carteret!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an impertinent minx.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I thought
your parents were happy for a few years? I was given
to understand that, although I never saw your mother
again and Gerald only came home twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before my time, then. I can remember back to the
age of four, and one of my first recollections is his knocking
my mother about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an expression! I suppose you mean he struck
her. It is bad enough, heaven knows, however you express
it. Gerald! I never thought he would so far forget
himself, for a gentleman is never more of a gentleman
than when he is in his cups. But he always had an ungovernable—yes,
a vicious temper. But what a handsome
dog he was! I was so proud of him. He was the youngest
of ten and I am afraid I spoiled him. Is that the
secret of your hatred of men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I should hope you had a better reason than that.
You should have too much common sense to judge all
men by one. What are your other reasons?” she asked
curiously. “I don’t understand you at all. Too many
years between us, I suppose. I don’t understand any of
the modern young women, and you appear to be the
most singular of them all. Not that I have met many,
bed-ridden as I am, but I have read some of the modern
novels and they horrify me. You have certain points
of difference, and I am thankful for that much. No
doubt it is because you are a Carteret. You are not a
fool at all events. Do you smoke cigarettes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t you ever dare bring one in here, or smell
of one. Do you drink cocktails?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. ’Fraid of bootlegger stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind you drinking a glass of wine with your
dinner. There is some old Burgundy and port in the
cellar, and, no doubt, a case or two of champagne. Tell
Topper to bring up anything you like—but only one glass
at a meal, though; and as the champagne is in quart
bottles——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, grandmother, but I really don’t care about it.
It’s time for your medicine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out into the light, and Mrs. Carteret looked
at her with a frown. “You <span class='it'>could</span> be a beauty,” she said
plaintively. “Why won’t you, my dear? And at least
don’t stick your hands in your pockets again when you
are in my presence—like a whistling schoolboy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t just now.” Gita’s somber face broke
into a smile that revealed even white teeth brilliantly
enameled, and for the moment she looked feminine and
roguish in spite of her cropped head and rigid spine.
“Let me lift you a little higher. You nearly choked last
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thrust her arm under the pillow and held the glass
to the old lady’s sunken lips, then lowered her gently
and returned to her chair in the shade of the curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret sighed. “You have your good points,
Gita, and I do wish you could have come to me before,
although a sick-room is no place for a young girl.
Eighty-two! It is a great age. Too old for a woman to
live to by thirty—forty years. Your generation won’t
live as long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hope not. But I wish you wouldn’t die.”
For the first time the hard boyish voice quivered. “I
haven’t anyone else. Why don’t you try this rejuvenation
thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. Thirty years ago, perhaps, if they hadn’t been
so long discovering it. But I’ve had enough of life.
Eighty-two! All the friends of my youth, all my children,
dead. Nobody left but you, and I do not love
you. You came to me too late and you are too different,
if you are a Carteret. But it is kind of you to say that,
my dear, and I am glad I can leave you independent, if
not wealthy. You will have the old place and about
eight thousand a year, although it may be less, what
with the inheritance tax and all.” A look of sharp
anxiety came into her eyes. “You won’t sell the manor,
Gita? I could not rest in my grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think of selling it. Sometimes I think I’d
like to live here alone for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. But it doesn’t take much to keep it up,
aside from the taxes. The grounds went to ruin long
ago, and the greater part of the house has been closed
since taxes and prices began to go up and my income
down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Carteret Manor was a great domain in the
seventeenth century, and even in your great-grandfather’s
time, but we were always an extravagant and improvident
race. There’s nothing left of the old manor now but
forty acres. Most of that is in woodland, although there
are two farms, rented to decent folk. The rest of my
small fortune is in securities, and there is a house in
Atlantic City. Mr. Donald will be over from Philadelphia
again in a day or two and I’ll tell him to have a talk with
you. If I thought I could live a year longer I’d transfer
everything to you, but there is some sort of law——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be rather a reckless thing to do!” For
a moment Gita’s brilliant black eyes softened as she
leaned forward. “I might sell out and skip, having first
run you into the poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have bad manners and worse language, but
I’ve lived too long to make any mistake about character——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of course I’m a Carteret,” said Gita mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. But it’s not worth talking about. I’ll
not live a month, much less a year.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There’s something
else. I’ve wanted to speak of it ever since you came,
but this is the first time I’ve had my way with that nurse
and the opportunity for something like a real talk with
you. Moreover—I suppose you’ll spit fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away. Don’t mind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s this. I don’t like the old name to die out.
None of my sons married except your father and William,
who died without issue. The other two died young,
one out yonder in the Thoroughfare, when he was fourteen.
Three of the girls died in childhood during a diphtheria
epidemic—my own Gita among them! Violet and Rose
withered away in this house, unmarried; they were plain,
and I would not countenance such suitors as they attracted.
In the few plain Carteret women the Carteret
spirit seemed also to be lacking. Evelyn had her full
measure. She cut a great swath in New York, where my
sister gave her a season, and then married to suit herself.
But she died childless—long since. Now, you and
I are the only Carterets left and unless you do as I
ask the old name will be forgotten—like many another
old name only to be found in some history of New
Jersey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” Gita’s crisp voice rose a key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should die content if you would promise me to ask—yes,
insist, that your husband take our name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never marry! Never! Never!” Now Gita’s voice
was harsh and defiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks. All girls say that. I said it myself—and
did not marry until I was twenty-seven. I was too
fond of being a belle—I had more scalps at my belt than
any girl of my time.” Again her gaze turned inward.
“My father was one of the founders of Atlantic City—one
of that group of far-sighted men that all Philadelphia
laughed at—and put more than a penny in the old United
States Hotel. Ah, what gay times we had! That old
hotel was the scene of my triumphs, season after season.
People of quality went to resorts in those days. Now
they avoid them as they would the plague, if one may
judge from the hordes on the Boardwalk. I used to be
wheeled up and down in one of those chairs before I was
bed-ridden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nothing but tourists——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why not?” demanded Gita, who was growing
restless. “It is a public walk and even tourists want to
enjoy themselves, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret, recalled, drew her scant brows together.
“I am not talking of rights,” she said coldly. “I merely
regret a time when the beach and even the Boardwalk
was a promenade of fashion, of beautiful well-dressed
women and handsome men. They were better to look
at, and I happen to dislike common and undistinguished
people. I hope you do not think yourself ‘democratic,’
among other things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I do. About the only decent treatment I’ve
ever had has been from ‘common’ people—until we went
to California, at all events. It was gentlemen, men of my
father’s class, that made my mother’s life unendurable.
And we hardly set up to be aristocrats on five cents a
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother should have written me she was in such
dire straits. I knew that your father was living extravagantly
in Europe but I never suspected he was spending
his capital. He told me on both his visits that he was
temporarily hard up. The first time I lent him a large
sum of money. The second time I refused, under the
advice of Mr. Donald’s father, and reproached him with
extravagance. He flew into a terrible temper, flung himself
out of the house, and never even wrote to me again.
Well, he died soon after.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I would never have
permitted his wife and child to suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother would have starved before she would
have taken a cent from a Carteret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She should not have permitted her child to starve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
However—there is one question I should like to ask
before we go further—and I have other things to say.
I wish you would move your chair into the light. I can
hardly see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita moved her chair obediently although with an impatient
jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret regarded her grandchild with a penetrating
sharp gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Answer me this question, truthfully, and without quibbling.
Have you actually no pride of race?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think such things ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do? And would you—honestly, mind you—rather
be a Jenks or a Hobbs than a Carteret? With no
generations of breeding and education behind you? Just
a common young woman with rudely modeled features
and a blowsy prettiness, without an atom of distinction?
Answer me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita moved uneasily. “It is good enough as a background,
I suppose. But I’m no snob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No Carteret was ever a snob. But they were aristocrats.
Vulgar people do not know the difference, and you
are not vulgar, absurd as you are. There are worse things
in life than poverty, and you may thank your stars you
have escaped a few of them, owing to your despised
Carteret ancestry. You begin where they left off, instead
of struggling from the gutter upward. You realize that,
I hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I realize it, grandmother. As you say, there
are a few things I don’t have to overcome. I know the
proper use of forks and I dislike a common voice and
bad table manners. Being a Carteret, so far, hasn’t been
of much use to me, but I am quite willing to make use
of what little it may do for me in the future. Does that
satisfy you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. But I trust to time to bring you to your
senses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was about to say, when my mind wandered to the
past—as an old woman’s will—that my intention never
to marry died a natural death when your grandfather
came back from Europe, where he had been in the diplomatic
service for years. I married him six weeks later.
You have had an unfortunate experience which has given
you all sorts of distorted views and ideas, but you will
get over them in time. Wait until the right man comes
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita writhed as much at the old-fashioned idiom as
at the idea involved. She set her lips in a straight line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never marry. Might as well make up your
mind to it, grandmother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady sighed heavily, although her eyes flashed
with temper. “Well! I shan’t live long enough to see
you come to your senses; but just mark my words: you
are a woman, a female, as you choose to call it, much
as you may resent the fact; and trying to look like a
boy does not make you one. You may hold yourself
like a ramrod, but you have a graceful body if it is as
thin as a plank, and the fine points of the Carterets. You
have a lovely round throat and your eyelashes would
make any boy ridiculous. Oh, yes, you are a girl, my
dear, you are a girl. Don’t grind your teeth. It’s bad
for the enamel. Now run out and take a walk. It’s time
for my nap—and I hear the starched petticoats of that
nurse.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> stood with her hands in the pockets of her sport
skirt surveying the old manor house from the drive. It
was built of oblong blocks of stone obviously cemented
together in the fashion of so many Northern Colonial
mansions: a great square box of a house, surmounted
by a gabled roof; without architectural grace but solid
and imposing, and immune to the elements and time.
The gardener was as old as her grandmother and the
lawns were thin, the rose-bushes and other flowering
plants looked as senile as himself. But the pine woods
on three sides were beautiful and dim and old, and Gita
was conscious of a thrill of pride in her inheritance.
She frowned, then shrugged her shoulders philosophically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? It’s all I’ve got. And perhaps a background
is something to lean against, anyhow.” She would
not admit that she had felt curiously at home from the
hour of her arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sauntered out of the park and across the bridge
of the Thoroughfare, a narrow body of salt water dividing
the mainland from the most famous of its islands.
Atlantic City amused her, but she did not turn toward
the town. Some distance to the south, below the hotels,
the Boardwalk had been demolished during a storm
uncommonly heavy for even that wild part of the Atlantic
coast; with its record, during the days of sailing
vessels, of thousands of wrecks and bodies washed ashore,
of evil men and false lights and ghouls crouching in wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the disaster to this end of the promenade it was
deserted by idle saunterers. Walking briskly, sometimes
running, with elbows pressed close to her sides, Gita made
directly for this solitary spot and sat down on the sands,
embracing her knees and staring out at the tossing ocean.
Gradually her hard spine drooped forlornly, and although
she scorned tears and self-pity, her mouth relaxed into
the soft and charming curves of her youth. She felt
small and desolate and alone. What was a dilapidated
old manor to a girl who had been deprived of a far more
significant birthright? If she could have grown up in
that old place, a Carteret of the Carterets, she would
have been a normal innocent girl, full of hope and day-dreams
and every kind of delightful nonsense. At twenty-two
she had not an illusion, and a horror and hatred
of life. And her mother, the one person she had ever
been able to care for, the one person who had it in her
power to make her feel young and human and necessary,
was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than once she had taken herself to task, scowled
ferociously at her distorted ego. Common sense dictated
that she should ignore her unfortunate experience of life
as too uncommon to warp any educated woman’s viewpoint,
readjust, reorient, herself. Other girls had had unfortunate
experiences—but not hers. Not hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her earliest memory was of Paris .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an old detached
house in Passy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a constant uproar downstairs that
kept her awake in the nursery under the roof .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ribald
laughter and singing, brawls, banging doors all over the
house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sometimes she would hang over the banisters
in her nightgown, shivering with cold, fretful but curious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Her mother with white desperate face, running
up the stairs, snatching the child, darting into the nearest
room, locking the door .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a man running after her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
mumbling at the keyhole, cursing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gerald Carteret,
later, pounding on the door, commanding her to return to
his guests and not make a silly little fool of herself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Her mother’s terrified sobbing, then quailing obedience
lest he keep his threat and break down the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And moving, always moving. As Gita grew older she
learned that her father and his guests not only drank and
caroused but gambled, sometimes all day as all night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that his friends persecuted her mother, whom they called
the Blonde Madonna. She received little protection from
her husband, with whom, nevertheless, she was at that
time infatuated; she hated him later. Gita begged her
mother to leave him and return to San Francisco, but
this seemed a poor alternative to the tormented Millicent.
Her parents were dead, her only relative was an aunt,
whom she disliked. She had no desire to return to a
city, where, in her first season, and to the envy of the
other girls, she had captured the handsome and dashing
Easterner, visiting polo friends in Burlingame. Now they
thought of her as living brilliantly in Europe, although
it must have struck them as odd sometimes that they
never were able to communicate with her in their many
trips abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, a wife’s duty was to her husband, no matter
what he might be. Even at the age of ten Gita sniffed.
But her lovely mother was the one perfect being in a
too imperfect world, and if she said it was right to live
with a man who was intoxicated most of the time, hit
her, subjected her to every form of insult, then right it
must be. But she conceived a strong distaste for husbands
and abominated her father, informing him more
than once she wished he were dead. He would scowl or
grin down at the small child, straight and defiant, and
smack her or toss her to the ceiling, according to his
mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carteret was an unlucky gambler, on the whole, and
lived “on the interest of his debts,” after his own and
his wife’s inheritances had expired. When his creditors
became too pressing he bundled his family out in the
night and set up in another capital. When fortune ran
with him he was charming and generous; when luck jibed
he struck his wife, his child, his servants, whoever got
in his raging way, raved like a madman, then collapsed
in drunken tears at his Madonna’s feet and implored her
forgiveness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita hated him increasingly, hated the other men, with
their well-bred dissipated faces, who persecuted her
mother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in time herself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Herself! These were the
ugliest and most indelible memories of all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This life, in which the war made no appreciable difference,
ended abruptly when Gita was sixteen. Gerald
Carteret died of typhoid fever in a French provincial
town where he was hiding from his creditors. Gita sold
her grandmother Sears’ engagement-ring, the only remaining
jewel, and buried him thankfully; then sat for three
months at her mother’s bedside in the charity ward of
a hospital, exercising her will frantically to keep life in
her mother’s exhausted body; a poor family in the neighborhood
keeping life in her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret recovered and the two faced starvation.
Then for her child’s sake Millicent wrote to her aunt, and
received much scornful criticism in return, more sound
advice, and a promise of a hundred dollars a month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that life was a succession of cheap pensions,
with poor food, dingy company, and always some idle
husband who made love to the indestructibly charming
Millicent; to the expressed indignation of his wife. Constant
peregrinations interfered with Gita’s schooling but
she received an education of sorts. She was quick at
languages and had ample opportunity to pick them up.
As men ogled her on the street as well as in the pensions
she abandoned the graceful languid carriage that had
been a part of her anxious training, throwing back her
shoulders and striding along like a stiff young soldier on
parade; finally, to her mother’s wailing accompaniment,
cut off her abundant black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have been a boy anyhow,” she told the
superlatively feminine Millicent. “It was a horrid mistake
of Nature. Then I not only could have taken you
out of this rotten poverty-stricken life one day, and given
you lovely gowns and delicate food, but I could have
stood up to these awful men that annoy you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was seventeen the old aunt died and left
her small fortune and the house built by the first Sears
to adventure in California, to “my only remaining relative
and not unloved niece, Millicent Sears Carteret.”
The heiress decided to leave Europe, which she frankly
hoped never to see again, and take her child to San
Francisco. It was far from Carteret Manor, pride had
gone the way of vanity, and she longed for her old
friends; moreover, Gita could finish her education and
have proper associates for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In San Francisco Gita was almost happy for two years.
She enjoyed her school, the cool electric climate, the
magnificent views, the drifting fogs, the long walks over
the hills, and the Chinese cook’s admirable confections.
Millicent’s friends were as faithful as she had anticipated,
and Gita drifted into a semi-intimacy with girls who filled
her at first with wonder and then with emulation. They
were very modern young people, with the wisdom of the
serpent, a fixed intent to do as they pleased, and a canny
ability to take care of themselves. Gita, with her extensive
and barely interrupted knowledge of the nocuous
side of life and the hideous lust of men, at times felt
old enough to be their grandmother, at others like the
little sister of these amused and cynical maidens. Her
mother had inculcated obedience, to one’s maternal parent,
at least, as the first law of nature, and the only time
Gita had ever defied her was when she had done her
best to transform herself into a boy. She had been as
severely chaperoned as was possible and admonished
against all things unladylike, particularly cigarettes. It
had been unnecessary to warn her against too free a
manner with men as she hated all men, and never danced
as she would have preferred to be embraced by a snake;
but the consequence was that she had not the most elementary
knowledge of flirtation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flirtation, however, she was informed by her new
friends, was out of date. Past was the day of subtle
methods, of practiced coquetry, of recourse to every
feminine device to win and keep a man, while he, poor
dupe, played the hollow rôle of hunter. The girls called
the “boys” up on the telephone as often as the boys called
them, and even took them out to restaurants and paid the
bill. This was the day of fifty-fifty, of equality of the
sexes. Gita looked in vain for romance, still in a measure
the mainspring of fiction. But these girls laughed at the
word, in spite of the movies, where, in the intervals
between parties, they took their followers of an evening;
conversation, apparently, was among the lost arts. One
young married woman told Gita casually that her husband,
after a more or less desultory wooing, suggested they
“hitch up,” and she had accepted him, not because she
liked him better than several others, but because his
type pleased her, she was in the mood to marry, and
wanted a baby. By this time Gita had ceased to blush
at a frankness which would have horrified her mother,
and at one time herself, accustomed to the finesse of
Europeans (when sober); and, with the plasticity of
youth, superimposed something of a new self upon what
she had believed to be a finished and permanent structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although, after her graduation, she went out
to dinners, she refused to go to parties, since that would
have meant dancing, and she recoiled from contact with
even these innocuous young men. Not, as she was aware,
that she would have been importuned for dances, for the
boys had “no use for her,” she was a “highbrow,” wasn’t
a “regular girl,” “ought to have been a boy and tried
to look like one.” The girls, with whom she was popular,
tried to give her “points,” but desisted when they understood
that her dislike of men was sincere, although they
did not guess the cause. If she could have brought herself
to tell the story of both her surface and her psychic
life to these wise maidens, no doubt they would have
blown the chaff from the wheat with their laughing common
sense, told her to “forget it,” remember that youth
was the only thing that mattered, and, when she had
had a good time for a year or two, marry and have a
baby. But Gita would rather have gone out into the
breakers at the Cliff House and drowned herself than to
have revealed the festering sores in her soul to anyone.
And no less than three noxious experiences with married
men, fascinated by her vivid youth and intolerance of
their sex, extinguished any possibility she may have unconsciously
cherished of forgetting the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon one occasion only did she appear to attract a
“boy.” He had made an average record in the war, was
the son of a rich man, and although he “played about”
with the girls he “fell for” none of them. The other young
men disliked and criticized him, but the girls retorted
that he was too good a dancer and mah-jongg player to
lose. One night he met Gita at a dinner, and more than
once she saw him watching her with covert speculation.
Later, with considerable finesse for a San Francisco youth,
he lured her into the conservatory, and after telling her
admiringly that she looked the real thing and made
chromos of the other dear little daisies, seized her in his
arms and tried to kiss her. He received an abraded
shin, a scratch across his cheek, and a loosened front
tooth, which sent him cursing out of her presence to
find an exit at the back of the house. They met some
weeks later and he said airily: “My mistake. Sorry.
Hope you’ll forget it.” But she knew that he hated her
and looked exultingly at the gold band across his front
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls discussed her psychoanalytically and decided
she had a complex, induced no doubt by resentment that
she had not been born a boy. On the other hand she
had not “rushed” any of them and was anything but
masculine, in spite of her funny little swagger and lack of
feminine adornment. Ann Melrose came nearer the truth.
“She is so precocious on one side of her that she may
have had a desperate love-affair at the age of sixteen,
and the man turned out a rotter. Did something that
horrified her. But if she doesn’t mend her ways she’ll
never give any other man the chance to administer the
right kind of shock. She’s about as approachable as a
hedgehog and as adaptable as a wire fence. ’Fraid she’s
got too much brains and not enough common sense.
Something gave her a bad twist. That’s good enough for
me. I’m sick of psycho. Too bad! She’s a game kid
and as straight as they come. Wonder how she’ll turn
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Gita was nineteen misfortune once more fell
upon them. The trustee of the small estate, failing in
his wooing of Millicent, absconded with all but the house,
which was mortgaged. Life was gray once more. They
took in lodgers, dismissed the cook, and did their own
work. Gita saw less of her friends, although they ran
in every few days and occasionally made the beds. Millicent’s
friends sent her hampers from the country and
carried her off now and then for a day in San Mateo,
Menlo Park, Burlingame, or San Rafael. One of her old
beaux proposed for the fifth time since her arrival, but
Millicent had had her fill of marriage. Moreover, she
knew that if she married again she would lose her daughter;
of whom, although she was a rather silly woman,
she had a considerable understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enterprise was not a success. The lodgers either
made love to their pretty landlady or did not pay their
rent and had to be evicted. Finally Gita turned them all
out and took in only women; to find that some were
respectable and others not. Recommendations were easily
forged. After a scandal Millicent sold the house for a
little more than the mortgage and accepted the position
of housekeeper to one of her friends in San Mateo, while
Gita taught French and Italian to a class of youngsters
hastily assembled. Neither would accept invitations for
“long visits until something turns up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, saw her friends constantly once more although
she refused to go to dinners or luncheons. Her clothes
barely held together, and they dared not offer her presents.
But she learned to ride, to play tennis, to swim
(in pools), and her naturally robust health, which had
been impaired by too much confinement and hard indoor
work, was restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Millicent’s spirit was broken and her
strength had been failing for some time. Gita took her
to a sanitarium for the tubercular on the California desert,
paying the expenses with the few hundreds left from the
sale of the house. On her death-bed Millicent wrote to
Mrs. Carteret.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> tide was coming in. Gita realized that she was
cold and rather tired. She ran along the beach to quicken
her blood, then took a trolley to the mainland. As she
walked up the avenue of the manor she saw a motor
standing before the door of the house and hoped she
would be able to slip upstairs to her room unseen. The
elderly and middle-aged daughters of her grandmother’s
contemporaries did not interest her and she was inclined
to pay little heed to the old lady’s adhortations to lose
no time making friends in her new life. She had been
at the manor a month and not met anyone of her own
age. Few of any other. She saw her grandmother in
brief interviews only, for the nurse maintained that this
alien relative excited the invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she was stepping carefully over the old rugs of the
hall she sniffed a familiar aroma, and then observed that
the door of the drawing-room was open, and that a
blind had evidently been raised. She had entered this
room only once, on the day after her arrival, when curiosity
had led her to explore the cradle of her ancestors.
She had felt no inclination to visit it again. It was
immense and dark and dreary, paneled with mahogany
to the ceiling and crowded with ill-assorted furniture
representing every period from 1660 to 1880. She assumed
that her grandmother’s funeral would be held in
its musty grandeur and after that it would be less inviting
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard a light movement. For whom could the
drawing-room have been opened today? Mrs. Carteret’s
friends were escorted directly upstairs by Topper. Curiosity
overcame her and she tiptoed to the door and
looked through the crack. Then her heart gave a leap.
A girl was standing in the middle of the room wrinkling
her nose. Gita forgot that she hated everybody and
remembered the unfailing kindness of her friends in
California. She had not loved any of them and was too
self-centered for intimacies, but they had given her what
little tolerance of life she had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This girl looked rather jolly. She wore a very smart
tailored suit that gave her the proper geometrical outline,
and the prevailing hat of a shape once identified
only with sport. Her face looked out triumphantly from
its austere setting, for it was a really beautiful face, with
its flower-like eyes and regular features. The bright fair
hair was shingled and a cigarette projected from a mouth
like pink coral. There was a touch of orange in the
costume and Gita noted vagrantly that it clashed with
the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita hoped she was not married. It was as impossible
to tell a young married woman from a girl as a smart
déclassée from a woman of fashion, and Gita was not
interested in babies and housekeeping. But a girl!</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, there was but one way to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entered the cold drawing-room and held out her
hand with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Gita Carteret,” she said. “I hope you have
come to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other girl removed her cigarette and shook hands
heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I? Rather. I’m Polly Pleyden, and as you’ve
rescued me from melancholia I’m that much more glad
to see you. Was just thinking of laying myself out to
see what it would feel like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s eyes sparkled with appreciation. “Isn’t it—just?
And we can’t talk in a mausoleum. Come up to
my room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! I’ve been walking about to keep myself from
freezing to death. Topping old house, though. Not
many of them left. Most of the old houses about here
were built of wood and have vanished long since. Luckily
for me the rats monopolized our old barn before I was
born and granny moved out to Chelsea. Not much tradition
there but plenty of light and modern furniture.
Glory! Do you sleep in that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had entered Gita’s bedroom. Large as it was a
four-poster seemed to take up fully a third of it, and
highboys, chests, an immense wardrobe, heavy chairs
and sofas, covered with horsehair, left little space for
movement. The windows looked out into the wood.
Gita had jerked off the bed-hangings on the night of
her arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” pursued the irreverent Miss Pleyden, “if you
ever get hard up you can sell this old junk. There are
imbeciles that will pay any price for mahogany and black
old oak. I’d pass out if I had to sleep in this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only do sleep in it! Take this chair. I’ve tried them
all and it’s not quite as hard as the others. Have one
of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I prefer Happy Stars. Debased taste. One
of the fell results of the war. Jolly old war. Did <span class='it'>us</span>
a good turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both girls smoked in silence for a moment, secretly
appraising each other. Miss Pleyden wriggled until she
made herself comfortable and Gita seated herself on the
one unbroken spring of a sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to stay with us long?” asked Polly. “I hope
so. I must give you a party and have you meet our
crowd. We do our little best to amuse ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you amused yourself,” said Gita, smiling.
“But I can’t go anywhere at present. My grandmother
won’t live much longer, I’m afraid, and I must
remain on tap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hope not! Over eighty, isn’t she? Well,
you’ll molder if you have to live here much longer.
Mother says she’s leaving everything to you, and I hope
you’ll sell this old tomb and buy something over in
Chelsea—no, I take that back. Even I’d keep this house
if I had it. All it needs is new furniture and not so
much woods.” She took off her hat and threw it on the
floor. Gita, now that this fashionable extinguisher was
removed, saw how completely beautiful she was. Such
locks as had been spared by the shears curled naturally
about her face. She had a charming little head alertly
poised; her forehead was low and full, her delicate nose a
straight line, her curved mouth soft and pink, with happy
corners. She looked sweet and innocent and utterly
charming and as cool and pure as an arum lily; but Gita
was wary of judging by Nature’s irrelevancies. And she
had heard her San Francisco friends discuss these Eastern
girls. “Hard-boiled, my dear, doesn’t express it. They’d
turn nails green. We’re little ba-bas beside ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you go out occasionally?” asked Miss Pleyden
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I go for a long walk every day. The salt
marshes fascinate me, and I never saw anything like the
Boardwalk. It is rather amusing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amusing is the word for it until you’re tired of looking
at people you never see anywhere else. Ever see
the Digue at Ostend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes!” But Gita scowled. She had particularly
unpleasant memories of Ostend. Her father had
gambled away his last sou in the Kursaal, and been obliged
to sneak out in the night as he could not meet his I.O.U’s.
And one of his friends! Gentlemen! Carterets!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t look so tragic about it—I’m going to call
you Gita and you must call me Polly—at once. Time
was, I’m told, when we Atlantans were cold and formal,
but that’s ancient history. Our poor parents try to
keep it up, but they’ve given <span class='it'>us</span> up. And then you are
one of us,” she added, sincerely casual. “Are you engaged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. Plenty of time. We don’t have to
marry these days for the sake of freedom, and life’s
one long dream when you haven’t a responsibility and
can do as you please. Thank heaven I was born twenty
years ago, not forty. Moreover, I’m waiting until the
men get over prohibition and stop acting like naughty
boys. I hate the sight of a hip-pocket. Some of the
girls drink because they think it’s funny or think the men
think they like it. But I’m afraid I’d go blind or something
or come out in a rash. Believe in keeping one’s
head, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather! Life’s hard enough without looking round
for ways to make it harder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come now, life’s a jolly nice proposition. I’ve
heard you’ve had a lot of trouble and I’m damn sorry.
Trouble never was meant for youth. We’ll change all
that when—ah—you’re free. No use blinking facts.
Old people have to die and not such a bad idea at that.
My granny was a real affliction. We had to kiss her
twice a day and she wouldn’t wear her false teeth. I
was always afraid I’d fall in. What’s your type?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Type?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Gita’s black brows met. “I don’t like any
type.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow! Wow! That’ll never do. I haven’t the least
respect for men, but life would be a desert without them.
When I’ve exhausted the girl racket and am ready to
satisfy my curiosity about those things our parents never
mention before us, I’ll pick out a New Yorker—father’s
one, thank heaven, and we spend our winters there—with
a few millions, dark good looks, and a pastmastership
in the art of love-making. About thirty, say. It
takes an American that long to acquire any sort of
technique. Then when that phase has run its course,
he’ll know enough to let me go my own way. I certainly
shall let him go his. Meanwhile a boy and a girl, blonde
and brunette. That’s the perfect life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita laughed for the first time since she had left San
Mateo for the desert. “Wonderful if life were as simple
as that! Why are you so sure you are going to have your
own way in everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you know what you want and go for it you get
it.” Miss Pleyden had a crisp metallic voice, which,
Gita inferred, expressed her ego more veritably than
her lovely shell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” said Gita. “All things being equal.
Life has always dandled you on her lap and fondled
your golden curls. But when she kicks instead of kisses
and you have to fight her every inch of the way, you
don’t get what you want, not by a damn sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly Pleyden gave her a long stare. “Now, that is
the last thing I should have expected you to say,” she
remarked. “You look high-spirited and courageous. You
don’t mean to tell me you’ve given up——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” Gita spat out the word. “I’ll fight till I die.
But I’ve no illusions. I’m not one of life’s pets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Gita Carteret, I’m not going to pretend
I don’t know a lot of what you’ve been through. All
your grandmother’s friends, including my mother, have
talked of nothing else since you got here. Uncle Bill
spent half his time in Paris before the war, and we cork-screwed
the whole rotten story out of him. Mrs. Gaunt,
mother’s crony, ran across your mother once, some time
after your father’s death. Met her in some provincial
town or other and carried her off to lunch—she had met
your mother when she was visiting here, just after she
had married, and admired her immensely; said she was the
loveliest thing she ever looked at, and far too good for
Gerald Carteret, who seems to have been the last word.
Well, she got a few things out of your mother, who was
too glad to talk to a woman of her own sort once more to
keep up her natural attempt at reserve. It wasn’t difficult
to find out she was poor and living in horrid pensions
on a pittance from some relative. But she made Mrs.
Gaunt vow she’d never tell Mrs. Carteret, and she never
did. You’ve had a rotten life and I don’t wonder you’re
bitter. But—how old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two.” Gita, angry at first, had softened at
the tribute to her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—that’s old in one sense, these days. Jane Bull
had had three affairs, married and settled down to a baby
before she was twenty-three. But on the other hand it’s
only a bit over three and one-tenth of the allotted span—less
if this rejuvenation thing pans out. Between our
new way of looking at life, and science, we can be young
about thirty years longer than any generation that’s preceded
us. What’s more, your troubles of one sort, at
least, are over. You’ll have an independent income when
the old lady shuffles off. For all you know life may
have done her worst by you at the start and have relented
for keeps. Don’t go on making faces at her.
That old saying about man’s being his own worst enemy
isn’t such a cliché as most. First thing you know you’ll
be down and out again. Come now. You’re young enough
to put all you’ve been through out of your mind and
begin over. And you’ve ripping looks, if you don’t mind
just one personal remark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” said Gita, almost humbly. “But
I don’t think it is possible to forget—the impressions of
one’s plastic years are indelible. It is easier, I fancy, to
forget at forty than at twenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe the will can do anything—in spite of Coué.
Fancy that’s what’s the matter with you! Too much
imagination, plus habit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. But I assure you I have no intention of
brooding too much and making matters worse than they
are. Now that I have the chance of ruling my own
life—as far as anyone may—I intend to get <span class='it'>something</span>
out of it. But men will play no part in it. Although
I’ll be glad to talk to any intelligent ones I may meet.
I haven’t met many so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can guess the reason for your hatred of
men,” said Miss Pleyden, who appeared to be disconcertingly
shrewd. “But that will wear off, now that you
are in a position where they no longer can take advantage
of you. As I told you, I haven’t any respect for the lot I
run with, but there must be men somewhere that have
glamour enough to make a girl feel she’s head over. And
what you want is a thumping love-affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds almost romantic.” The subject was distasteful,
but Gita was forced to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not romantic. Merely undiluted nature. Fancy we
all get it sooner or later, although nothing’s worrying me
less at present. But what I haven’t seen I could inscribe
on my thumb-nail. You’re built for it. Just you
refurnish this old barrack and leave the rest to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll refurnish it if there’s money enough—air it,
anyway. But I’ll stay here for a time and read——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake don’t tell me you’re intellectual!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far from it. Been too busy. But there are many
things I ought to read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you dare queer my little game! Or if you will
read tomey books keep it dark. It’s what you don’t
know that gets you there. Life’s the Book, anyhow,
when you’re young.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There’s no hope this summer,
but you’ll visit me in New York next winter if I have
to kidnap you. I haven’t been so interested in anyone
before in all my young life. Wish I’d called before, but
mother said you were inhuman and I kept putting it off.
So did the other girls, but they’ll be along soon now. I’m
Columbus, however, and shan’t let them forget it. That
means I must go—mother’s been calling on Mrs. Carteret—but
I’ll be over again in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A motor-horn had sounded discreetly. Miss Pleyden
caught her hat on the point of her swagger-stick, tossed
it to the other hand, settled it carefully on her head,
opened her vanity-case and applied her lip-stick. Then
she sprang to her feet and laid her hand on Gita’s
shoulder. “You’re all right,” she said emphatically. “I
had an idea you weren’t——Well, never mind what I
mean,” as Gita jerked up her head. “In some things,
I fancy, you’re as green as mint. Dear old Dr. Freud
would say you were heading straight for the rocks, but
there’s a thing or two he didn’t know when he set to
work on the sub. Fancy you’ve been saved by a sound
endocrine constitution. You see I know a thing or two
myself, even if I never let on, owing to a perfect policy.
There’s another toot. We’ll have to go down.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> felt inclined to dance as she swaggered about
the dilapidated old garden, her hands in her pockets.
She felt uncommonly buoyant. Whether she liked Polly
Pleyden or not she hardly knew, but the creature was
certainly stimulating. And the future looked less gray.
She would have felt no desire to go to the wild parties
she had read about during those long days on the desert,
even were her grandmother well and amenable, but if
the other girls were as amusing as Polly she would have
a lot of fun with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>California had helped her, but it was time for another
superstructure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would it be like? For a moment her feet in
their heavy boy’s shoes danced on the path. Then she
saw Topper approaching and tried to look indifferent
and dignified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Carteret would like to see you, miss,” said the
old butler, who never looked otherwise than dignified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran into the house and up the stair and for the
first time showed a smiling face at the door of the sick-room.
The old lady was sitting up in bed, an antiquated
jewel-casket open beside her. She gave her grandchild
a sharp glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! What you needed was young folks,” she commented
dryly. “Polly Pleyden is a frivolous, fast, pert,
painted minx, but I suppose she’s better than nothing.
If she’d been properly brought up she’d have called a
day or two after your arrival. But never mind Polly.
Come here. I’ve something to show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, more interested in the contents of the casket than
in her grandmother’s opinion of Polly Pleyden, came to
the side of the bed and bent over a tray of necklaces,
bracelets, rings, and brooches. The settings were old-fashioned,
but the stones: diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
were of fair size and perfect clarity. For the moment
she felt acutely feminine. Her eyes sparkled and she
touched them lingeringly with her finger-tips. She had
read stories demonstrating the fascination of jewels, but
had never imagined that her own response would be keen
and ardent. In jewelers’ windows she had not given
them more than a casual glance. But to be as close to
them as this! To touch them, to bend low over their
fire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For a moment she was almost angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lift out that tray,” said Mrs. Carteret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next held a rope of pearls, large, evenly matched,
very white, and with a sheen that gave Gita a curious
thrill. There was a sense of life, of mystery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
strangely remote and desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always wore them at night until lately to keep them
from dying. They are to be yours, of course. Put
them on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita lifted the pearls over her head reverently, and ran
to a mirror. “Are they really for me?” she gasped. “How
can I thank you, grandmother! I never knew that pearls
were beautiful before. But these! Mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! You’re not a boy after all! Good.” Then as
Gita frowned she added hastily, “Come back and lift out
this tray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the large compartment beneath was a heavy and
hideous tiara of diamonds and emeralds. Mrs. Carteret
sighed. “I suppose you’ll never wear it. I’m told such
things are no longer in fashion. But many’s the time I
wore it in the old Academy of Music—and in Covent
Garden. Evelyn wore it in her day and was the most
splendid figure in the Metropolitan Opera House. Her
husband sent it back to me when she died.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, you
can have the stones made into a necklace when you are
older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? Am I to have all these wonderful jewels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else? But you are not to sell them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d never dream of selling them. When I’m blue I’ll
just take them out and play with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the first sensible thing I’ve heard you say.
And many are heirlooms, remember.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was a
magnificent diamond necklace your grandfather gave me,
but it went to pay racing-debts after an unfortunate
season at Saratoga. He was a good man, but insane about
horses. I often feel thankful he died before this era of
shrieking motors. They would have broken his heart.
Sit down and play with these things now. I see they
have cast a spell over you and I am beginning to feel
hopeful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita took a low chair beside the bed and poured the
contents of the upper tray into her lap, letting the chains
run through her fingers, trying on the bracelets and
rings. The fine stones seemed to wink at her knowingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll have to be reset,” said the old lady sadly.
“Tout passé. Now,” she added briskly, “there’s another
thing I want you to promise. If you don’t I’ll leave every
one of these jewels to a hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grandmother! Blackmail! What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must wear mourning for me. I’m told it’s more
or less out of date, but I believe in the decencies of life.
You say neither you nor your mother approved of
mourning, but that has nothing to do with me. You will
do as I ask, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.” Gita was in a mood to promise anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s one point gained! And six months will
be enough. I’m only your grandmother. But after that
you are to dress not only like a girl, but a fashionable
girl; you’ll give those ridiculous suits to the servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all the girls wear tailored suits—and as for
sport——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like yours? No furbishing up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they wear scarves and bright hats—other things,
I suppose. I’ve hardly noticed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have noticed they indulge in every feminine
vanity, even if they’ve cut off the hair that Nature meant
to be woman’s chief adornment and have neither the
full busts nor the swelling hips that once made a beautiful
woman’s ‘figger,’ as we called it. And the tiny waists!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have looked horrid,” said Gita sincerely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Quite the contrary. I wonder men are
ever attracted to women these days. Nature intended
women to have figures entirely different from men. Else
why didn’t she make them on the same plan and save
them the trouble of starving themselves? Answer me
that!” said the old lady triumphantly. “A girl in my
day, my daughters’ day, had no chance if she looked like
a lath. She padded. And these young ninnies of today
may have a certain style but not a particle of elegance.
No wonder they wear little straight frocks. It takes a
figger to show off elegant gowns. What in the world
started such a fashion?” she asked querulously. “Do you
mean to tell me men admire girls that look like boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seem to. Probably that’s the reason the girls
have sacrificed woman’s chief adornment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But men used to rave over woman’s tresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the men nowadays don’t rave much except over
bootleggers and motors. Perhaps that’s the reason they
want the girls to look as much like themselves as possible.
Or maybe they’re more in love with themselves
than ever since the war and the girls imitate them without
realizing it is a sort of subtle flattery.” Gita was unconsciously
groping. She had never given the matter a
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret cackled, her frail body shaking. “I suppose
that’s the reason you shaved your head, didn’t even
leave a few locks in front to cover your ears and soften
your forehead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” Gita forgot the jewels. “I should think not. It’s
about the last reason!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, jewels and hairless heads don’t go together. It
will be a good time to let your hair grow, while you’re
in mourning, and some clever hair-dresser will find a way
to tuck it up. I suppose it is naturally straight but it
could be waved. And that reminds me. I am making
you promise a good many things but this is one of the
most important. When the proper time comes Mary
Pleyden will introduce you to Society, and you are to go to
the best dressmaker you can afford and wear the most
elaborate clothes that fashion permits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is very elaborate these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I understand. But you are to dress like other
girls—the most sensible and feminine. That’s all I have
to ask. Is it understood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, grandmother, but I don’t care for clothes,
really——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never had ’em. That’s the reason. You’re a stoic, I
imagine, and wouldn’t permit yourself to want what you
couldn’t have. Wait until you have a wardrobe full of
pretty things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shrugged her thin shoulders. “Perhaps. But I
don’t care for society either, grandmother. I—I—don’t
know how to dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard of such a thing! But you can learn, I
suppose. You’re naturally graceful. You wouldn’t be a
Carteret if you weren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita hastily changed the subject. “And I never know
what to talk to men about. I’d really rather live quietly
here and go over to New York occasionally—to the
theater and concerts and lectures. And the opera! I
haven’t been to an opera since I was fourteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shocking! Well, go to the opera and show yourself.
And as for men they’ll soon teach you what to talk
about, or you’re not a Carteret. We were all great
gabblers. Now, put those jewels back in the casket and
put that in the wall-safe over there behind the open
panel, before that nurse comes back. She may be as
good as she looks, but I never trust outsiders. I told
her to send up Topper and he got it out for me. You
may keep the pearls. Wear them as often as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Gita had hidden the casket she returned to the
bedside and brushed her lips against the old lady’s tabid
cheek. “You are very kind and generous, grandmother,”
she said gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks!” Mrs. Carteret’s voice was as dry as usual
but her eyes gleamed. “And your lips are very soft, my
dear. Here comes that woman. It is time for your dinner.
And when you have replenished your wardrobe I
hope you will dress for dinner every night, even when you
are alone.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>That</span> was Gita’s last talk with her grandmother. The
next day Mr. Donald called, and on the following
the old lady had what the nurse alluded to vaguely as
one of her attacks. Two nights later she died quietly
in her sleep. At the earliest moment consistent with
cherished proprieties, Topper telephoned to Mrs. Pleyden,
and she came to the manor an hour later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly had a telegram from Bar Harbor yesterday
asking her to a house-party,” she said sympathetically
to Gita, looking as if she would kiss her if she dared,
“and she went off last night. But she’ll be home in a
few days and I know she’d want you to come to us for
a bit. You will, won’t you, my dear? You’ve hardly
had time to get accustomed to this gloomy old house.
Do run up and pack a bag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita shook her head. She felt uncommonly bereft.
Her grandmother was a person to be missed,
whether she had unconsciously grown fond of her or
not. At all events she felt a desire to stand by until the
last of the ceremonies. And the old house, in which so
many of her blood had lived and died, mysteriously held
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” she said. “And I’ll be glad to
see Polly when she comes back. But I’d better stay
here. I’m sure grandmother would have wished it. If—if—you’ll
attend to things, though, I’d be grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will indeed.” Mrs. Pleyden was a tall slender
woman, admirably dressed and poised, but although her
life for the most part was spent in a round of bridge, she
was by nature executive and always willing to exercise her
talent. Her house in Chelsea and her apartment in New
York were models of bland extravagance and housewifely
skill. In an earlier day she would have been a “leader,”
and, as it was, her large and exclusive circle deferred to
her and regarded her as a personage. Between herself and
Polly there was an unspoken compact. Mrs. Pleyden
moved with the times, and life had taught her philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better go out of doors,” she continued. “Perhaps you
will change your mind later, but meanwhile don’t stay
in the house any more than you can help. I’ll do the
telephoning, and Topper always knows what to do. He’s
seen many a funeral in this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shuddered and went out into the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more intimate of her grandmother’s friends were
in and out constantly during the next three days. Flowers
arrived by the motor-load. The heavy perfume in the
unaired rooms was unendurable. It seemed to Gita as
if all the dead Carterets had fertilized the roots of those
flowers and contributed their odor of decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady lay in state, not in the drawing-room but
in the great central hall. Her face looked like an ancient
wax mask. It was devoid of expression, and it had had
so much in life! Gita did not give it a second glance.
She preferred to remember that wise sarcastic old face on
the pillows, lit by the indomitable dark brilliancy of the
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden had telephoned to a New York house for
Gita’s mourning and it arrived early on the day of the
funeral. It was merely a straight little frock of crêpe de
Chine and a black straw hat like an inverted bowl, from
which a short veil of chiffon depended. Gita wondered
what her grandmother would have thought of it. Her
crêpe veils no doubt had trailed the ground like those
of the afflicted in French provincial towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rummaged in the drawers of a chest in the old
lady’s room and found a long necklace of jet and oxidized
silver and put it on. The act made her feel less modern
than usual, but she thought, somewhat humorously, that
her grandmother would approve of this subtle, if momentary,
linking of her unruly descendant with the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had heard the rolling of many motors, and as she
descended the broad stair she saw that the hall as well
as the large and smaller drawing-rooms were crowded with
ladies and gentlemen, who, as she learned later, had come
not only from Atlantic City, but from Philadelphia and
many of the country estates in New Jersey. It was a
last tribute from friends and acquaintances that would
have pleased Mrs. Carteret, although she would have regarded
it as a matter of course. The Carteret funerals
had always been affairs of state, a signal for all affiliated
clans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were even reporters on the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper, in a rusty dress suit, once in the wardrobe of
Mr. Carteret, and black gloves, was master of ceremonies,
and Andrew, the old gardener, bent nearly double with
rheumatism, had been given a chair near the casket. The
other servants, housemaid and cook, were more recent
acquisitions, but sniffled audibly. Topper’s eyes were
red, but no Carteret could have presented a more immobile
front to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald, the family lawyer, met Gita at the foot
of the stair and offered his arm. She was conscious of
a ripple of decorous interest and several hundred examining
eyes as they made their way to the upper end of
the hall and took the seats reserved for them. There were
no young people present. Polly, who had returned the
night before, had telephoned that she would be over after
the funeral; she would pass out if she found herself at
one of those hang-overs of barbarism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita privately made up her own mind that it was the
last funeral she would ever attend. In an effort to look
grave the company was as if suddenly bereft of individuality,
and all the women who possessed black gowns
wore them whether they were cut in the latest fashion
or not. The pall-bearers, most of them keen business or
professional men, looked like expressionless mutes. Mr.
Donald, who was one of them, wore a band of black
cloth on his sleeve and flourished a handkerchief with
a black border. Polly would have said he looked like
a walking monument to conservatism, but he was an
urbane and pleasant person, inclined to be fatherly in
manner to his younger clients and had been sincerely attached
to Mrs. Carteret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The atmosphere was sickening. The day was hot and
close. Several of the women surreptitiously inhaled
smelling-salts. The clergyman in his Episcopal robes
droned on interminably. Not a phrase of the long funeral
service could be omitted on so august an occasion. Gita
felt as if she were on the verge of hysterics. At her
mother’s simple funeral on the desert, where Millicent
had asked to be buried—she was “tired of traveling”—Gita
had felt only numbness and desolation, and had
passively permitted herself, when it was over, to be carried
off to San Francisco by Mrs. Melrose to await a possible
letter from Carteret Manor. The numbness had
not passed until she found herself alone in the train,
free of solicitudes and plans for her future, should Mrs.
Carteret ignore her. But today she felt a wild desire to
laugh and shock some sort of expression into these portentously
solemn faces. What a comedy! They were
swooning with boredom and tuberoses, and what one of
them had really cared for her grandmother? More than
once they must have writhed under her merciless tongue.
But it was an inherited ritual to attend a Carteret funeral
and they were stern devotees of the passing conventions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sonorous voice rounded its final period. There
was a sigh, a rustle. Mr. Donald left her to join the pall-bearers.
Mrs. Pleyden took her firmly by the arm and
led her past many staring eyes to her own motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going with me to the cemetery,” she said
kindly, “and then I’ll turn you over to Mr. Donald, who’ll
bring you home and read the will to you in the library.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Abominable!” She had heard the click of a camera.
“But your features will hardly be distinguishable through
that veil. I only hope the paper is one that decent people
take in.” She looked askance at the necklace but concluded
to ignore it. Tact never failed her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> casket had been placed on its shelf in the Carteret
vault and wreaths and crosses piled to the roof.
Mr. Donald conducted Gita to his motor and they returned
in silence to the manor. Gita drew a long breath.
Her grandmother had made her final exit. She might
regret, but she had mourned too deeply for her mother
to confuse regret with grief. And she was conscious of a
thrill of expectation. She had seen plays where wills
were read by a solemn lawyer to a solemn family and
thought them highly dramatic. Now she was to be the
central figure in such a scene and that old library would
be a proper setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper was standing in the hall. She gave him her
first order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please send all these flowers that are left to some
hospital—at once. And open every window in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper, who distrusted fresh air even by day, shook
his head in protest, but his eyes fell before the dark
imperious gaze that had mastered his will for seventy-odd
years. He had never expected to have a young mistress
in his old age, and he and Andrew retired to the
pantry and wept into two generous glasses of old port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita followed Mr. Donald into the library and opened
its windows herself. It was a very large room with books
to the ceiling, galleries, alcoves, flights of steps. Over
the paneled oak mantel was a half-length portrait of her
grandfather, at which she had scowled more than once;
it bore a fatal resemblance to her father. The room,
when closed, had that subtle odor of death that comes
from rotting calf, and, possibly, from those silent emanations
of brains long still. But when the sunlight poured
in and the salt winds from the Atlantic purified the air, it
looked less like a tomb of dead thought, merely a dignified
old library in a stately old manor house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita took a chair close to one of the windows and Mr.
Donald settled himself with a sigh of relief in a large
leather chair by the central table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This has been a trying day,” he said, “and I am not as
young as I was. I shall miss my old friend, who was a
remarkable woman, Miss Carteret, a remarkable woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Gita sincerely, “she was. I wish I could
have known her longer—and that she could have been
sixty instead of eighty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald looked at her approvingly. Proper sentiments,
certainly. Hardly to have been expected perhaps,
brought up as she had been, and with her boyish hardness.
He had never before seen a Carteret who did not
look feminine, however imperious. He had met her
twice before and had anticipated impatience, slang, and
a total lack of respect. But Gita looked rather meek
sitting there by the window and quite properly subdued.
She had laid aside her hat, and her rough cropped head,
which had excited her grandmother’s ire, and no less his
own, was bent over a honeysuckle bush, inhaling its delicate
fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful head. Mr. Donald studied it against
the light, and with approval. Lines of face and head
perfectly balanced. Set on a long throat. Small high
ears. A spirited profile and the magnificent black eyes
of the Carterets. It was something, at least, that this
girl was a Carteret in looks. But what was she inside
that almost blasphemous exterior? Had she any regard
for tradition, or would she take the bit in her teeth, laugh
at his advice, sell the manor in spite of her promise to
her grandmother, and behave like a young colt generally?
She looked as if her next step would be to wear trousers,
and Mr. Donald, who gave the present generation of
young people his unqualified disapproval, wished she were
more like them and less like an absent-minded compound
of Old Dame Nature. He was a mere sixty, but he had
inherited the Carterets from his father and known many
of them, although none that gave him a clew to this
last of the line. However, he was used to trouble and
generally knew how to deal with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cleared his throat, adjusted his spectacles, and
opening his bag, drew out a document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the last will and testament of your grandmother,”
he said solemnly, “and, as is customary, it is
my duty to read it to the family immediately after the
final ceremonies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Gita, smiling, “I always wanted to hear a
will read. I know what is in it, but it will be fu—interesting,
all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald frowned. “This is not an occasion for
levity, my dear Miss Carteret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Sorry. But I really do want to hear a
will read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you romantic?” asked Mr. Donald hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good lord, no! But I have a sense of drama.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shall not argue the point. But I think—first—may
I ring for Topper and order a glass of sherry?
This really has been a very trying day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, yes!” There was no lack of Carteret hospitality
at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper brought the sherry and retired. Mr. Donald
filled two glasses, handed one to Gita, and lifted his own
gallantly. “Here’s to your very good health, Miss Carteret,
and a long and useful life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Gita dryly, but drinking the sherry,
of which she suddenly felt the need. “Same to you. But
please call me Gita. Miss Carteret doesn’t suit me at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!—well, yes—I’ll call you Gita with pleasure. And
now I shall read this last testament of my dear old
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to read in a dry legal voice. Gita, warmed
by the sherry, smiled at the lines beginning: “Being of
sound mind,” etc. Nothing more aptly could have described
her grandmother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carteret, after generous bequests to Topper and
Andrew, left her entire fortune to Gita, with instructions
that she give her late grandfather’s studs, cuff-links and
scarf-pins to Mr. Donald, who was named sole executor
of the estate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It consists of this house and grounds, two farms, a
house on States Avenue, Atlantic City, and good securities,”
Mr. Donald informed his client. “There are no
mortgages. The value of the estate after the inheritance
tax has been paid will be something under two hundred
thousand dollars. The rent of the house in Atlantic City
just about pays for itself these days, what with taxes and
repairs. When the present lease expires I should advise
you to sell it. It was built for your grand-uncle, Byllynge
Carteret, who left it to your grandfather in payment for
moneys borrowed at various times. Most of those old
homes have been turned into boarding-houses, since
fashion moved out to Chelsea, and summer visitors come
to Atlantic City in increasing hordes—the great majority
of whom cannot afford the hotels on the Boardwalk.
But——” He paused, coughed, and polished his spectacles.
“I hope, my dear Gita, that you do not contemplate
selling or even renting the manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not sell it, but I certainly shall rent it if I
should at any time want a larger income.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be almost as bad,” grumbled Mr. Donald,
who, however, was relieved. “Of course it is rather a
dismal home for a young girl, and I can imagine you would
prefer to live for a time in a large city; but I feel sure
that later in life you will be glad to know that you still
possess this historic old manor of your ancestors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ancestors are not worrying me. I’m glad I’ve no
relations to ding-dong about them. But I like the old
place and I intend to hang on to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—yes—well, I’m glad to hear that. May I ask
if you have any immediate plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I intend to stay here for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t do better. Finest climate in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better say that to a Californian! Must you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald had disposed of his spectacles and risen.
“I am very grateful to you,” added his young hostess with
unexpected graciousness. “And to my grandmother. If
she hadn’t left me all this I’d have had to go to work. I
hate work, and all the insincere jargon about it. Nobody
works who doesn’t have to, even those who have
great gifts that demand expression. They merely go on
mental jags and enjoy themselves. Otherwise there’s no
joy in work well done. The only joy is not having to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald was returning to his office to prepare a
case to be argued in court next morning and felt no
inclination to exhaust himself in debate with a young
woman who would probably fling one defiance after another
at his head under the impression that she was
modern. He answered suavely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very creditable of you to think for yourself. And it
certainly would be unbecoming for one of the Carteret
ladies to work for her living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t worrying me, either. My objections to
looking for a job and holding it down are purely personal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very modern.” Mr. Donald sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s rather old-fashioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean in your complete indifference to tradition. But
that seems to be one of the many phases of the present
unrest. The war no doubt. Now, is there anything else
I can do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you will continue to take care of the estate?
I am hopelessly ignorant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the greatest pleasure!” Another apprehension
was laid. In money matters at least this young rebel
did not purpose to take the bit between her teeth. “And
remember, if you need advice of any kind my services are
at your immediate disposal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to sell the house in Atlantic City at once and
renovate this. I’ll keep the best of the furniture, of
course, but the rest will go to the stables. My grandmother’s
room I shall keep intact—as a memorial to
the Carterets!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t blame you. But the lease of the house
on States Avenue has a year to run. After the inheritance
tax has been disposed of I’ll see what can be
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Sooner the better. Perhaps I could persuade
the Pelhams to get out. Topper says they left
cards and that gives me an excuse to call on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Donald gave his smallest and tightest smile. “Try,
by all means,” he said. “And your luck seems to have
changed. Now, I must really bid you good-day. I shall
be over again shortly with papers to sign.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was Easter Sunday and Gita was strolling along the
Boardwalk. Mr. Donald had considerately sent her a
check and she had bought a small black sailor hat,
which she wore on the back of her head that her cropped
hair should further demonstrate her complete indifference
to feminine allure. She had also invested in a black sport
skirt that she might be able to keep one hand in a pocket,
and in the other she carried a swagger-stick. A stiff white
shirtwaist and black tie completed her toilette. She flattered
herself that she looked like a boy masquerading as
a girl and was somewhat disconcerted when no less than
two passing men murmured, “Cutie.” Then she was
abruptly a haughty young woman—and a Carteret—freezing
impertinent libertines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I only <span class='it'>were</span> a boy,” she sighed. “I don’t believe
I’d even mind work. And girls are ten thousand
times nicer than men. Then I could fall in love with one
of them, and now that is forever denied me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not really feel sad. The warm gold sun
rode in an unflecked sky. The sea rolled in to the white
sands in long sparkling indolent waves. Over the hard
beach young people were riding horseback and children
were driving little carts, or building in the sand. A great
liner drifted on the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Boardwalk was so crowded that Gita was forced
to move at a far more leisurely pace than her habit, and
it seemed to her that in all that vast throng there was but
one expression: a composite expression of vacant contentment.
If they were subject to the common misfortunes
and cares of humanity, for the present they were unable
to recall them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there she saw a woman fashionably dressed,
but to what world she belonged Gita did not hazard a
guess. There were perhaps a hundred tailor-made girls,
as slim as laths, very trim, very conscious that they were
turned out by one of the autocrats of fashion. But the
mass were frankly tourists with no money to spend on
anything but cheap imitations of the prevailing styles.
There were college boys arm in arm and walking four
abreast, and large carefully dressed males with roving
predatory eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the close monotonous procession of rolling chairs
propelled up and down the middle of the broad promenade
by colored men or white derelicts, were couples
too fat and overfed to walk or too old and tired. A few
elderly ladies and gentlemen looked as if they may have
sauntered on the Walk in its heyday and still came for
the ozone which no change in fashion could alter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita wondered what the façade of Atlantic City had
looked like when these devitalized relics were in their
prime. Today hotels of varying magnificence, with at
least one triumph of modern architecture, were connected
by a flimsy chain of low-browed buildings: Japanese
or Chinese curio-shops; shops for linen, lingerie, sweaters
and blouses; candy-stores; shops devoted exclusively to
salt-water taffy, “cut to fit the mouth”; restaurants, motion-picture
theaters, bookstores, shoe-stores, milliners;
displays of costumes unapproachable in elegance and
price; cigar stands, cheap rooming-houses, toy-stores,
drug-stores, auction-rooms, art-shops of highest and lowest
quality; booths where silhouettes were taken while you
wait, stands for post-cards, newspapers, magazines; jewelers;
five-and-ten-cent stores. Interrupted at set intervals
by flights of steps or “inclines” leading down to the
avenues of Atlantic City. Opposite, reaching far out into
the water, six monstrous piers offering concerts, soft
drinks, moving pictures, tearooms, ballrooms, and long
decks for chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a scene both vulgar and splendid, extravagant
and tawdry, mean and aspiring. If a tidal wave washed
away all but the hotels it would have a certain stark
magnificence, but the miles of pigmy shops gave it the
appearance of a chain of village Main Streets that made
the great hotels, not themselves, look alien.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless the ensemble was gay and exhilarating.
Above the mass-murmur of voices rose the cry of the
barkers and the deep surge of the Atlantic. These slowly
moving smiling crowds gave to the scene an air of careless
and unqualified leisure to be found nowhere else in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind and below the Boardwalk, between the Inlet
and Iowa Avenue, Atlantic City proper, a dignified town
of a prevailing gray tone, rambled back to the Thoroughfares
and the salt marshes, and on the south merged into
the faubourg of Chelsea. It was a town with a life of its
own and regarded its façade as almost if not wholly
negligible. Its social life, like that of other small towns,
revolved about its churches, Episcopalianism representing
the flake of the crust, and its women’s clubs were
often storm-centers of politics. The men had their professional
and business clubs, and some sixty leading citizens
met for a weekly luncheon at one of the city hotels
either to talk business or forget it, and to sing, with the
abandon of boys, the sentimental songs of their youth.
Atlantic Avenue, a broad if unpicturesque thoroughfare,
had its enormous trolleys that went from the Inlet to
Longport, at the southern tip of the island; but Pacific
Avenue, with its fine Public Library, its churches and
reserved private houses, relied on the humble jitney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a bustling city but it had a constant surge
of life, and there was no apparent poverty except in the
negro quarter, whose denizens found compensation in a
conscious political power. And it was a proud city, for
all its streets were avenues, its shops were serenely independent
of the extortionists on the Boardwalk, the best
of its private houses looked like dignified old folks, well
preserved but with no pretensions to youth, and its air
was tonic. Visitors in the great frontal hotels, looking
down on the quiet little gray city, assumed that oyster-dredging
was still its main industry, and the humbler
patrons of the hundreds of hotels and boarding-houses
of the town accepted it as an annex to the Boardwalk
and knew as little of its life as of its history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had often wandered about the town, which attracted
her more than Chelsea or Ventnor, for although
far from contemporary with the manor it represented the
vision and enterprise of that group of men, including
her great-grandfather, who had founded it in the early
fifties, and now it had an elderly dignity and beauty
of its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her slow progress had brought her to the incline that
led down into States Avenue and she edged her way to
the rail and looked over at a large gray wooden house
with a round pointed tower. It was on the north side
of the avenue—once but a footpath leading from the
old United States Hotel to the beach—and, like its neighbors,
belonged to a definite and debased period of American
architecture. Many of her enterprising great-grandfather’s
friends had left Philadelphia to become permanent
residents of the new city, either for business reasons
or for fashion, and this street demonstrated their theories
of comfort and grandeur. A few of their descendants
had magnificent houses out on the avenues of Chelsea or
Ventnor, others had succumbed to adverse fortune and
quietly disappeared. A very few perhaps still lived where
their fathers or grandfathers had built. Several of these
old houses, once the pride of Atlantic City, were boarding-houses
for the better class of vacationists who could
not afford the palaces on the Boardwalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had spent two hours on that famous promenade
and not seen a familiar face. Nor was she likely to see
one if she spent the day there. Polly and the girls she
had brought to the manor during the past week scorned
it wholeheartedly. They might exercise there in the early
morning and swim off their secluded beach when the ocean
recovered from the chill of winter, but to show themselves
in “that crowd” had no part in their program of aristocratic
democracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, who had entertained her new friends in aired and
sunny rooms from which at least a third of the furniture
had been removed to the stables (by two stalwart sons
of her farmers, the while Topper and Andrew muttered
a continuous protest) had lost her desire for solitude,
and wondered if the Pelhams were at home. Easter Sunday
was no time for a formal call, but Gita, whether
fundamentally a Carteret or not, ignored the conventions
when it suited her purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She descended the incline and strolled up the avenue
to the least remunerative of her possessions. The
blinds were raised and several of the windows were open.
It was after twelve and if the Pelhams had attended
church, as no doubt they had—the church, if not religion,
playing so dominant a part in the lives of their kind—they
would have returned. The midday dinner and
Easter Sunday! Gita shrugged her shoulders and ran up
the long flight of steps: the house, following the rule,
was built above a high cellar as a precaution against the
rare but always possible furies of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Pelhams had a late breakfast on Sunday and
an early supper. When the colored maid brought up
Miss Carteret’s name they were in their respective bedrooms
enjoying the somnolent ease that followed a morning
well spent. Chelsea had no more contempt for the
Boardwalk than States Avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pelham was the first to descend. She was offended
at the informality but as curious as her daughter
to see this heir of the Carterets, who had been the subject
of much rumor and several newspaper paragraphs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a very tall woman, thin and austere, with
iron-gray hair dressed high and flat, and wore a gray
dress over corsets as rigid as herself. Even the gold-framed
spectacles did not soften her expression. She was
a member of the church most active in local politics and
all reforms, and the president of a very important club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita felt like making a face but advanced and held
out her hand in Millicent’s prettiest manner. “Mrs. Pelham?
I am Gita Carteret and I do hope you won’t mind
the informality of this call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all,” said Mrs. Pelham stiffly. “Won’t
you sit down? It is very polite of you to call so soon.
I hardly expected to see you for several weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ambiguous remark, but Gita replied sweetly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was feeling lonesome after two hours on the Boardwalk
and had a sudden desire to meet old friends of my
grandmother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pelham looked as if about to thaw, then darted
a suspicious glance at her visitor. “Hardly that. I used
to meet Mrs. Carteret occasionally when we sat on the
same charitable boards, and she was once very kind when
I was ill. But I did not feel that I had known her well
enough to attend the funeral. Of course I left cards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is this class-consciousness? thought Gita. Do self-respecting
Americans really recognize county?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were lucky not to feel you had to,” she replied
warmly. “It was ghastly. Public funerals—and weddings—should
be abolished; don’t you think so? Both
are indecent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do not agree with you. I rank both among
the <span class='it'>decencies</span> of life.” She looked at Gita as if she approved
of nothing about her, but it was a look to which
Gita was inured and she merely smiled and crossed her
knees, swinging a foot conspicuous in an Oxford bought
in the boys’ department of a shoe-store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke a silence that threatened to induce hysteria,
recalling the gossip of Topper, who knew the lineage and
habits of every family from Egg Harbor to Cape May.
“I hear you go in tremendously for good works. That
must get away with a lot of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My time is fully occupied and I certainly do my duty
as I see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—ah—yes. I’ve heard that Atlantic City is particularly
fortunate in its women citizens.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And then
she sprang into the arena. “I suppose you always intend
to live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most certainly. I was born in Atlantic City—we once
had our own house but it burned down—and I expect
to die here. I hope you will renew the lease of this house
when it expires—but of course you leave business details
to Mr. Donald?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a hint of anxiety in her rasping voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether. I——You wouldn’t like to buy the
house, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like nothing better, but unfortunately I am
unable to afford it.” There was a gleam of real apprehension
in her hard gray eyes as she stared at Gita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I must sell it, then.” Gita was now completely
indifferent to the impression she was making on
this disagreeable person as well as to the fact of Easter
Sunday. “You see, it brings me in no income whatever
and I really need more money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot give up this house!” Gita almost jumped.
There was a note of fighting passion in the woman’s
voice. “I have lived in it for thirty years. My children
were born in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I’m sorry.” She felt curiously disconcerted, almost
sympathetic, but after all she was not turning
paupers into the street. “Perhaps—I hardly know what
to say. Mr. Donald advised me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could take in paying guests. We have several spare
rooms. I never expected to come to that but I’d do it
and pay you more rent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so much a matter of income——” And then
she rose with a sigh of relief. A girl was coming down the
stairs, and she looked as unlike her presumable mother
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pelham stood up. “My daughter, Mrs. Brewster—Miss
Carteret,” she said in her stiff precise manner. “I
hope you will excuse me for a few moments.” And she
hastily left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mrs.!’ ” said Gita, smiling once more as she resumed
her seat on a chair as hard as any at Carteret Manor.
“I was sure you were a girl like myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am only twenty-six, and I’m a widow. My husband
died a few months after our marriage. But that seems
a long time ago—I was just twenty. I hear this is your
first visit East. I hope you like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they exchanged easy commonplaces on the fertile
subject of the Boardwalk and Atlantic City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brewster was as slim as Gita and hardly as tall.
She, also, held herself erectly, but without stiffness; her
dark blue frock was of excellent material fashionably
cut; and, observed Gita, who had an eye for clothes,
singular in one who disdained them, as well “put on”
as Polly’s. Her brown hair was cut short and brushed
back from a brow of unfashionable nobility, and her large
light eyes were both intelligent and humorous. Gita
thought she had never seen a more emphatic little nose
nor a more determined chin. If she had ever suffered
she bore no trace and looked as if her vision would always
be set toward the future in confidence and hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the conversation became more personal Gita learned
that Mrs. Brewster was buyer for one of the department
stores on Atlantic Avenue, a position that took her frequently
to Philadelphia and New York. She felt slightly
bewildered. It was her first acquaintance with a girl of
the business class, and she had assumed vaguely that
all members of that order were hard and common. She
had once dreaded a similar fate, and although, she told
herself, she could not be harder, she had wondered if
she would wholly forget the anxious training and admonitions
of her mother. But Millicent might have had
the bringing-up of Elsie Brewster. Gita wondered if she
were a snob and felt secretly humiliated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t like work?” she asked, determined to
get to the root of the matter. “You—you look, rather,
as if you were both a student and fond of a good time
like other girls. Once I thought I should have to go to
work, and, frankly, I hated the bare idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brewster smiled. “If you have to do a thing
it is better to like it than hate it, don’t you think? But
you are rather shrewd, you know. As a matter of fact
I am fond of reading and study, and my job leaves me
a good many hours of leisure. I also love good times,
of course, but when you have a certain object in life——”
Her voice faltered and she blushed and glanced hesitatingly
at this odd visitor who looked like a boy with
an eager girl’s face, and whom she had thought at first
she should find detestable. But Miss Carteret was not
in the least like other masculine women she had met, and
when she forgot to be hard and crisp her voice had deep
warm notes that were as attractive an anomaly as those
long black eyelashes under that awful sailor hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” asked Gita, who was now neither the polite
Miss Carteret nor the aggressive lad but merely one girl
interested in another. “Do tell me what is the object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie Brewster smiled as warmly in response and succumbed
to the revulsion of feeling. “You see—I lead a
double life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” Gita’s eyes sparkled. There was no mystery
whatever about Polly and her group. “What on earth do
you mean? You’re not secretly married again——Oh!
No! That would be too commonplace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think so. No—but this is quite a secret—my
ambition is to be a writer—a novelist, if possible.
I’ve had a few things accepted by the magazines: two
or three by the best, others just anywhere my agent could
place them. Of course it will be a long time before I can
make a real income out of writing and give up my job—my
mother’s income hardly covers the rent of this house
and her subscriptions to charities, and club dues—what
I make supports us very comfortably. Reputation—the
kind that is remunerative, at least—takes time; but I
know I shall succeed in the end!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you would.” Gita glowed with enthusiasm.
“I’m frightfully interested. I do wish I had a
gift. But I should think that after a hard day’s work
you’d be too tired to write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I am, but as a rule I manage to put in three
or four hours at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are wonderful! Where do you write your
stories?” She glanced around the stiff inhospitable room,
furnished in the reps of the seventies. “In your bedroom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I have a real study. Should you like to see
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shouldn’t I! Lead me to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She followed Mrs. Brewster down the long hall and
into a small room fitted up with a large flat desk to which
a typewriter was firmly attached, a swivel chair, revolving
bookcases, stands for dictionary and atlas, and a filing
cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Businesslike, isn’t it?” asked the young author. “I’m
afraid system has become a part of my nature, and am
always wondering if it will cramp my imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should it? I’m horribly disorderly myself and
can’t do a thing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Is—is this a story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was standing by the desk and she passed her hand
with a lingering touch over a pile of manuscript, much
as she had fingered her grandmother’s jewels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I finished it last night, and it will start off
tomorrow on what may be a long and adventurous journey.
But if it were rejected by every editor in the country
nothing could take away my pleasure in writing it!” she
exclaimed with sudden passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet it couldn’t.” Gita’s eyes roved over the little
room; it seemed to her the most personal room she had
ever entered. “Do you write all your stories here?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t believe I could write anywhere else. If
I used the word ‘atmosphere’ I suppose you would think
I was talking cant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I shouldn’t.” But her heart sank. And then she
sighed. The manor would have to wait. She would not
turn Elsie out of this room if Mr. Donald talked his
head off, although it would have given her acute pleasure
to annoy that disagreeable old woman. “I—I really came
today to give a gentle hint to Mrs. Pelham that I intended
to sell the house when the lease expired, but you
may tell her I’ve changed my mind. You see, it tickles my
vanity to think that great books may be written in a
house belonging to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Elsie Brewster had turned white. “You——Oh,
you wouldn’t! It’s an ugly old shell but I love it, and
I couldn’t write anywhere else. I’d feel as if my roots
had been torn up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Needn’t give it another thought,” said Gita briskly.
“Cut it out. Don’t you want to come over and see my
old tomb?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like it very much. I have always longed
to see the inside of that old manor. To tell you the truth
I once made it the scene of a story, although I had to
make up the inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure it was an improvement on the original. It
couldn’t be worse. Do get your hat and come along. I
told my old butler not to have luncheon until half-past
one. Do you mind walking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love a walk. Just a moment.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, now that she was in command, had her meals
served in the breakfast-room, as nothing could make
cheerful, in the daytime at least, a long high room paneled
to the ceiling, whose windows looked directly into somber
pine woods. This little room, facing the garden, was
bright and cheerful as the girls sat at lunch. It was a
meal to satisfy the appetite rather than caress the palate,
for Mrs. Carteret, during the last year of her life, had
lived on broths, gruels, eggs, and milk, and the cook had
“got her hand out,” as she informed her new mistress
somewhat apprehensively: it had been an easy place and
to the grumbling of nurses she had been haughtily indifferent.
Gita, who had a European palate for flavors,
had no intention of keeping her and asked Mrs. Brewster
if she knew of a good cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t afford a chef, of course,” she said, “and I
don’t know enough to train anyone, although I cooked
for my mother and myself for a time in San Francisco.
But I hate the sight of a kitchen and my accomplishments
in that line were limited to meat and vegetables, generally
overdone. But I should be able to get a fairly decent
cook for what I pay this moron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know just the thing.” Elsie Brewster was delighted
to be of service to this girl whom she liked more every
moment and was anxious to study. “That is to say if your
Topper would stand for it. The woman is colored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Topper’s opinion will not be asked,” said Gita coolly.
“He will suit his tastes to mine or leave. I have no
sentiment about old servants, and I am sure he must
have saved a lot, to say nothing of my grandmother’s
legacy. I’ll make him a present of the discarded furniture
and he can set up another boarding-house in Atlantic
City! Send your darky along. I’m enormously obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do keep Topper!” cried Elsie. “What would an
old manor be without an aged butler? He’s an indispensable
part of the tradition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he can’t live forever,” said Gita practically.
“And I think the less you bother about traditions the
better you get along. Old servants think they own you,
anyhow, and there’ll be only one master in this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t fancy he owned your grandmother. I used
to see her sometimes when I went to the Episcopal church
with a friend, and thought her quite the most imperious
person I had ever seen. You looked just like her when
you said that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. Or maybe it’s only because I can have things
my own way for the first time in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie looked at her speculatively, wondering how she
could get this odd girl to talk about herself. Gita Carteret
was a new type in her somewhat limited experience,
and it was a confirmed habit to edge everyone she met
under an avid and microscopic eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have met Miss Pleyden,” she began tentatively.
“I wonder what you think of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a good sort. So are several of the other girls
she has brought here. Not unlike the San Francisco girls,
only more so. But I never could live their life. I fancy
I’m old before my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brewster laughed outright. “I never saw anyone
look younger! It is difficult to believe you are twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Gita gloomily, “I ought to look forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you wouldn’t like to look forty. Come, now,
own up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, I wouldn’t.” Gita was forced to smile.
“I suppose that sounded like a grand little pose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t imagine you in a conscious pose of any sort.
But, you know, youth can go through a lot without being
hopelessly scarred. Otherwise—I have heard vaguely that
you had a hard time for a few years, if you’ll pardon
me—you wouldn’t look a bare eighteen when you are
four years older. I felt very old myself at your age, for
I had loved my young husband devotedly; and now I feel,
and look, younger, and, I am willing to confide in you,
I have almost forgotten the poor man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hoped, by throwing open a window in her own
soul, to hear a quick rattling of the shutters opposite,
but Gita replied with a frown: “Underground is the
best place for husbands as far as my observation goes.
I think you were in luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. Although he really was a delightful chap.
Still, if he had lived there is no doubt I should be doing
the plain domestic act today: several children, repetitional
cares of a small house, teas and bridge-parties for diversion.
I doubt if I ever should have found myself. The
life of a business woman seems to me infinitely preferable,
and if I didn’t have this writing kink I’d be quite happy
in it. Still, I think every woman should marry, even if
it cannot last, one way or another. No woman can be
thoroughly poised, able to look at life on all sides, and
with a clear analytical eye, unless she has lived with a
man in matrimony. Other thing is too one-sided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some women, perhaps. And as you’re a writer no
doubt you have to know it all. But there is no necessity
for the masculine woman to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie bent over her pudding. “Do you really think
yourself masculine?” she asked indistinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am!” Gita’s voice flew to its upper register.
Her grandmother’s and Polly’s gibes had made
little impression on her conscious mind. She ascribed
them to personal interest and the conventional viewpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—I must ask it—I can’t help it!—why don’t you
cut off your eyelashes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut off my eyelashes!” Gita raised one narrow sunburnt
hand and stroked them tenderly. “If you want the
truth I love my eyelashes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you do. And your lovely head and magnificent
eyes and all the rest of your beauty, badly as
you treat it. But, my dear, I am going to say it if you
never speak to me again: you don’t look the least like
a boy and you never can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She expected to witness a full and final exhibition of
the Carteret temper, but to her surprise Gita answered
gloomily: “I’ve begun to be afraid I don’t. Two of those
horrid men on the Boardwalk this morning tried to
flirt with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did they say?” asked Elsie eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t repeat it.” And her eyebrows were an unbroken
black line above flaming eyes at the memory of
being called “Cutie.” She, Gita Carteret!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be one thing and it might be another,” observed
Mrs. Brewster cryptically. “A girl trying to look
like a boy would only amuse some men, but it might
lead you into excessively disagreeable experiences with
others. To say nothing of—well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy you have seen too much of one side of life
and very little of another. If you’ll take my advice you
will go up to New York—I’d love to go with you!—and
buy a lot of feminine frocks and hats. Of course you are
in mourning but there are adorable black things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate feminine frocks. Besides, if I’m good-looking
I never would be able to keep men off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never will, anyway, but you might have a—well,
more satisfactory measure of success if you cast yourself
for the part of the cold and indifferent beauty. That’s
rather out of date, but as men today are averse from
effort of any sort in their relations with women, accustomed
to be met half-way, in short, I fancy you’d be able
to manage. But do you really never intend to marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really do not! If you knew what I know of men
your books wouldn’t be fit for publication. What sort
of stories do you write, anyway? Realistic or romantic?
Are those the terms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Gita had eluded her, but she replied with
every appearance of eager response: “Terms are out of
date but principle remains the same. I write both. When
I’m sad and tired I write romance, and when I’m feeling
particularly buoyant, I write small-town stuff, with husbands
going about the bedrooms in suspenders and forgetting
to brush their teeth; and revolting wives (both
ways) scraping out the kitchen sink. I always give particular
prominence to grease. When the sink is clean, if
it ever is, she turns her attention to the fly-specks and
marks of heads on the wall-paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s eyebrows were in their proper place and she
was grinning delightedly. “I think you’re a whacker!”
she exclaimed. “Do you ever write of New York? That
is the one city I long to see—I’ve barely had a glimpse
of it. I’m going up to all the theaters and concerts and
just walk the streets. Will you come along? I’d love to
have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Brewster’s eyes glowed, but she answered firmly:
“I don’t know anything I’d like better, but I simply won’t
walk the streets with you if you insist upon wearing those
clothes—and that hat. In the first place it’s a crime and
in the second I dislike being conspicuous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita looked sulkily at her plate. “I’ve dressed like
this since I was sixteen. My mother didn’t like it, and
she was the only person I cared enough about to mind
whether anyone liked it or not. But I’m used to it. I
should feel awkward and intolerably strange any other
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only for a time, and in mourning you wouldn’t notice
it so much. You’d be quite accustomed to it by the time
you went into colors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should feel as if a part of my personality had been
lopped off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary, you’d give your personality its first
chance to develop itself. If you really had a hard masculine
face—the kind that goes with authentic masculoid
characteristics—I wouldn’t say a word. I’d not be interested
enough. But your type of beauty—real beauty—is
the sort to express itself through clothes. Do you really
hate beautiful and expressive gowns?” she demanded.
“Hate the sight of them on other women?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I like to look at them well enough. And I see
at once if details are not right. I fancy I have what
an old Frenchman I once knew called ‘le sentiment de la
toilette.’ But all that is merely the same thing as knowing
a good picture from a bad. I was dragged through all
the picture galleries in Europe, and I lived in Paris off and
on, where the women are the best dressed in the world.
I appreciated them the more because I lived so much in
French provincial towns, where the women are certainly
the worst dressed in the world. And my mother had
lovely things when I was little, and always managed to
look better in old rags made over than many that spent
thousands a year. But I never longed for things myself—never
gave it a thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you had censored your mind so thoroughly.
Don’t you really think that if you hadn’t—for reasons
best known to yourself—adopted the rôle of pseudo-boy
so young, you’d have been as feminine in all ways as
other girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, quite unconscious of Elsie’s delicate probing into
her past, answered obstinately: “Never thought about it.
Or if I had I’d have been glad of another excuse to spend
as little as possible on myself. We were frightfully poor,
and even in San Francisco, where, for a time, we thought
the worst of our troubles were over, we just about made
both ends meet. At least we couldn’t save. If I’d been
keen to dress like the other girls we’d have been in debt
up to our necks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper, who had received instructions to keep out of
the room except when he was serving, had made his final
exit some time since, but the girls lingered on with their
coffee and cigarettes. Elsie made a curious zigzagging
movement along the table with a spoon, denting the cloth;
here and there she made an upward curve or straight
mark as irregular in height as the crooked line; then,
suddenly, she broke off, skipped an inch, and drew a high
firm object that looked not unlike a barred gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you doing?” asked Gita curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Outlining your life as I imagine it—in a hazy sort of
way. It has never followed the even course of other
girls of your class or you wouldn’t be what you are.
These upward curves and straight marks represent abrupt
changes and milestones. But that”—she pointed to the
last figure—“is more than a milestone. It represents a
barrier that shuts you off completely from your old life.
It opened wide enough to let you through but it is closed
and sealed forever. You could not go back if you wished,
and I know that you wish nothing less. Behind that barrier
is a life you hate to remember. Before it, where you
find yourself now, are the pleasant places and all the most
romantic girl could have wished for, who was not too
extravagant. Position, freedom, an independent income,
powerful and admiring friends, and the chance to be
stared at as an authentic beauty. Don’t you think you
should change with it? If you don’t you’re not as original
as you look. Why! You’d be merely commonplace,
obstinate, content to go on being one thing all your life.
Don’t you know that the really intelligent woman these
days crowds as much variety into her life as life will
permit? And adds as many sides to her personality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” Gita had turned pale. Her mouth was open
and her nostrils dilating, as if her heart were beating irregularly.
“That is something I never thought of. I
do like change, and maybe I am obstinate—but I’m not
commonplace! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps the time <span class='it'>has</span> come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyhow
I promised my grandmother I’d let Mrs. Pleyden
bring me out, and dress like other girls. She was dying
and had been very generous with me, and I couldn’t help
promising her. But she died a day or two later and I
hadn’t thought of it since. But of course I’ll have to
keep my promise—and I might as well begin now of my
own free will,” she added characteristically. “And if I
really can’t look like a boy, what’s the use? I suppose
I’m too old for such nonsense anyhow. I used to feel a
lot older than I do now—and looked it, I imagine.” She
shot an almost apologetic glance at Elsie, who was beaming:
she knew she had succeeded where others had failed.
“Reaction, I suppose, and I really never wore such an
ugly hat before.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I won’t—and this is positive!—ever
marry, or even dance with men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let the future take care of itself. I can think of
nothing now but of helping you buy frocks and hats in
the New York shops. I know them all—just where to go.
Luckily the hat of the moment comes almost to the bridge
of the nose, and by the time fashion changes, your front
and side hair will have grown out. I’ll ask for my vacation
now if you’ll really start in right away to fit yourself
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. And send the bills to Mr. Donald! Although
he’s rather a dear and sent me a check for two-fifty the
other day. I’ve spent hardly any of it. Come upstairs
and see the jewels my grandmother gave me. I suppose
I’ll have to be forty before I can wear most of them, but
it’s jolly to have inherited lovely things to look at—although
I’d forgotten them till this minute!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, for the first time since her childhood, possessed
a completely feminine wardrobe. Mrs. Brewster had set
her face against even the most girlish and apotheosized
of tailored suits, and persuaded Gita to buy a soft black
frock of unbroken lines, to which were attached white
linen cuffs above the half-sleeves, and a long white collar
about the sloping neck; the opening, after furious controversy,
displayed the lace of a camisole. Little frocks
for the morning, suitably if austerely embellished. A
soft silk hat pulled down over the ears, but with an
ascending brim that revealed sleek sweeping eyebrows,
and a tri-cornered one of straw. Two dinner-gowns, one
of satin and one of georgette. Peach-bloom underwear,
silk stockings, slippers, uncompromisingly feminine shoes.
Mr. Donald paid the bills with a sigh of relief. What
had brought his difficult client to her senses he knew not
but drew the natural inference. He hoped the man was
the right sort and would hasten to relieve him of an
onerous responsibility. If he were not he would do his
duty and remonstrate, but the girl was over age; and
no one could blame him if she showed as poor judgment
in husbands as she did in other things. She was the only
young woman of his acquaintance who inspired in him
no fatherly sentiments whatever. She reminded him of a
prancing colt with a vicious pull on the bit, and he had
been moved to wish that she were one and he could give
her a taste of the whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made subtle inquiries and learned that she lunched
in Chelsea or Ventnor occasionally, and that she was more
frequently in the society of Elsie Brewster, at which he
frowned. Still, Mrs. Brewster was a steady-going young
woman, as feminine as Polly Pleyden, and a good deal
more respectable. And of course she was a lady—according
to middle-class American standards—although the
family had never aspired to social eminence and were not
even Episcopalians. But the mother came of respectable
Atlantic City stock (out of New England), and although
Mr. Pelham had been in trade (hardware), like his father
before him, he had been an educated man, a fine citizen,
and a member of the Chamber of Commerce. Elsie had
graduated with honors from the High School, and was
now considered one of the rising young business women
of Atlantic City. She had the respect and admiration of
everyone. Still, Mr. Donald knew that Mrs. Carteret
would not have permitted the intimacy, and he frowned
in sympathy. He knew better than to remonstrate with
Gita, however. All he longed for in that quarter was
peace and quiet. Democracy was the rage among the
young fools anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie, who prided herself justly upon being a psychologist,
had insisted that Gita abandon pajamas and buy
at least six nightgowns of fine cambric, delicately embroidered
and trimmed with lace. Gita had protested, as
she had done steadily throughout the entire program—although,
being honest, she wondered if it were not for
the pleasure of yielding, not merely the angry mutterings
of outraged habit—but had jerked her shoulders finally
and growled: “Have your own way, but I’ll feel like a
fool. Lots of the girls wear pajamas.” “Yes, but they
offend my artistic sense. I’d as soon arrange roses in
my best bowl with weeds instead of maidenhair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had also wrung from Gita a promise to give her
old clothes “from the skin out” to one of Mrs. Pelham’s
charities, and shuddered when she found in the trunk
Gita fetched in a taxi a plentiful supply of B.V.D’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>are</span> thorough!” she exclaimed. “I only hope
you’ll keep it up. Mind, you are to dress every night
for dinner, as your grandmother wished, and you are to
look at yourself approvingly in the glass later when
you’ve on one of those nightgowns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita felt bewildered and at times almost unhappy.
She opened the doors of the mahogany wardrobe, which
had sheltered so many changes of fashion, and fingered
the soft texture of her gowns, and felt a thrill of pleasure
in their flowing lovely lines. She folded and refolded the
dainty contents of the drawers of the oaken carved highboy,
as old as the manor, which still smelled faintly of
lavender. She put on one of her white linen frocks in
the morning and adjusted the black accessories with
conscientious precision, or looked admiringly at her reflection
in the “psyche mirror,” clad in white skirt and
black silk sweater. She dressed for dinner in the black
georgette, and shot a fleeting glance at herself when robed
more simply but more elaborately for the night. Her
hair, encouraged by violent brushing and a tonic, was
springing out all over her head with an exultant life of
its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was suffering from spiritual growing-pains, and
felt as if she were learning to use a new and unclassified
set of muscles and nerve arcs. There was a more superficial
readjustment as well, for she found silk “queer”
after B.V.D’s. and fancied it scratched her. The high-heeled
slippers hurt her feet, and she was trying to
limber her spine and cultivate the careless grace of other
girls, although she had no intention of looking as if she
were too weak to stand up straight. Elsie was erect
without rigidity, and of course she could get the hang
of the thing if she tried hard enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She also felt considerable resentment at the approving
glances and mutters of Topper (who knew when he was
beaten; moreover, had succumbed to the culinary graces
of the new cook), and the staccato applause of Polly
Pleyden. But this, she ruthlessly informed herself, was
egoistical resentment at the intimation that she had been
sadly in need of improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for six years she had thought herself into the rôle
of a boy, even pecked her mother on the cheek like a
boy, and, in their worst moments, reassured Millicent
with bluff crisp phrases instead of the usual feminine endearments;
to the end she had scorned sentiment and
demonstrations, and, to the amazement and disapproval
of Mrs. Melrose, had not shed a tear at the sad little
funeral on the desert. “Boys do cry, you know,” the
kind but exasperated lady had observed, while indulging
freely in tears for the friend of her youth. “If you will
play a part why not be consistent about it?” But Gita,
who was wishing herself in the grave with her mother,
had merely looked straight ahead, with the expression,
Mrs. Melrose told Ann later, of a wooden Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been furious with herself more than once for
her secret pride in her eyelashes and had considered
mutilation, but after various specious excuses: the breaking
of her mother’s heart, their value as a sun-screen,
etc., she had finally admitted she would as readily cut
off her nose. Once, when she caught herself examining
her fine Carteret profile with the aid of a hand-mirror,
she had thrown the glass out of the window and filched
from her father’s vocabulary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a matter of will induced by a special
neurosis, but the accomplishment had stopped just short
of perfection, and the effort to make herself over into a
girl with a girl’s easy grace of carriage and mental lineaments,
made her feel bruised all over. It would have
been almost as easy for a cripple to stand erect and run
a race. She was not only disoriented but apprehensive.
Her semi-masculine garb and mental posturing had been
like a protective armor, absurd, perhaps, but inspiring
her with security and confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she felt, she grumbled to herself, like a knight
whose armor had been ripped off by the enemy, a turtle
that had lost its shell, a bandit who had gone out to
hold up a train and discovered he had left his “guns” at
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But—there was no denying it!—having deliberately
let down the bars and made a bonfire of them, her vanity
was acting like a hungry bear after a long winter’s sleep.
It surged over her in singing waves as she regarded herself
in the long mirror when arrayed for dinner in one
of the soft clinging frocks that revealed arms and the
upper part of a neck (Elsie scowled at models high in
front and bare to the waist behind) that, however thin,
were round and smooth and of the tint of old ivory. She
smiled with lips very red and sharply curved, that had
been reclaimed (under Elsie’s orders) from their perverse
hard line; at her bright black eyes with their curved lids
and lashes that under artificial light were reflected in the
clear light olive and red of her cheeks; at the sweep of
her eyebrows and the slender firmness of her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she would fall into a panic and feel an impulse
to crawl under the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning following her first surrender to sheer
femininity at the psyche mirror and its almost terrified
reaction she hired a horse on the beach and spent two
hours galloping over the sands. Here, at least, she could
wear a manlike coat, and breeches, and ride astride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all this she never spoke to Elsie Brewster, and if
the agile mind of her mentor darted close to the truth,
that wise young woman was content with her large measure
of success and, if only out of delicacy and loyalty,
probed no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave Gita all the time she could spare, dined with
her frequently, encouraged her to come to the office on
Atlantic Avenue, and took her on several buying expeditions
to Philadelphia and New York. She sometimes felt
like a sculptor with a promising but singularly uncertain
piece of clay in his hands: clay with unmalleable lumps
and responsive but slippery surfaces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was kicking off a slipper from an aching foot one
night, when her leg was arrested in mid-air. Something
had been tapping at her conscious plane for several weeks,
an elusive something, gone before she could rake it to
the light. Now it darted forward of its own accord, and
it seemed to her that an actual entity took form in her
brain, smiling significantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For years she had had the same dream, and nearly
every night. She had stood alone on a solitary mountain-peak,
with barely a glimpse of the world below. The
figure had been as aloof, as isolated, as the mountain
itself. And it was always staring up at another peak,
higher still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She realized that she had not had that dream for a
month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, much good may it do me,” she thought, as she
kicked off the other slipper. “Coming down to brass
tacks and liking them is all very well, but I still wish
I had been a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, standing before the mirror arrayed in the
daintiest of her nightgowns, she wondered if she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders, climbed into her ancestral
four-poster and turned off the light by the bed. “Anyhow,
I was born a philosopher,” she thought sincerely
if erroneously, “and perhaps when I can afford a human
bed I’ll feel more like the real thing. I might put bows
on the corners.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, who was on her knees in the garden planting carnations,
her favorite flower, but keeping one eye on
Andrew and the new gardener, prepared to act summarily
at any sign of violence on the old man’s part, turned her
head as she heard a taxi rattle up the avenue. Then she
sprang to her feet and ran toward the house. Her morning
visitor was Elsie Brewster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anything the matter?” she asked anxiously. It was
only ten o’clock and Elsie had never accepted an invitation
to luncheon. No man in Atlantic City was more
sternly devoted to business between the hours of nine and
five than the capable Mrs. Brewster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie’s face, usually as placid as the pool in the woods,
was flushed a bright pink and her eyes sparkled with excitement.
“Something wonderful has happened!” she exclaimed.
“And I had to come over and tell you at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me you’re being sent to Europe!” Gita
had a sensation of blank dismay at the prospect of separation
from this resourceful and interesting friend, the only
one whose constant companionship she had ever craved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wouldn’t excite me the least little bit. But
don’t try to guess. I’ll tell you. Come into the library
where it’s cool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita ripped off her gauntlets and threw them on the
floor of the hall. Her broad-brimmed hat followed a yard
farther on. “What on earth can it be?” she demanded
impatiently. “Don’t tell me you’re engaged.” She glared
at Elsie, who had removed her hat and thrown herself
into one of the deep chairs by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, my child, it’s not that or I shouldn’t have
dared to face you. I’d have prepared the way by a
note——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! What is it? What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I ever tell you that I have a brother? I’ve
hardly dared mention the word man in your presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother once said something about a son out
West, somewhere or other, and of course I assumed that
those snap-shots all over the house of a young man in
khaki were his. Not bad-looking as men go. Has he
struck it rich?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall begin at the beginning.” Elsie had labored too
long at craftsmanship to tell a story haphazardly. “You
know, his medical course was interrupted by the war, and
when he came home he returned to Columbia to finish.
He hated to have me work, but mother’s income had
diminished like that of everyone else, and he knew he
could do far better by us later if he had a profession than
if he chucked it and took a job with little or no future in
it. Besides, he was always mad on the subject of surgery.
He used to dissect rabbits in the back yard when he was
eight, and when he was ten the cook broke her arm and
he had it in splints before the doctor got there. Then,
too, he had a lot of experience in the army, where he was
always in attendance on some one of the surgeons. He
got the Croix de Guerre for operating under fire when
the surgeon in charge of the hospital had been killed,
and then coolly loading the patients into an ambulance
and driving it off as the Germans rushed the town. Well,
he graduated about two years ago and went to Butte,
Montana, with a fellow graduate—a doctor of medicine—whose
father was in charge of a hospital there and
had offered him the position of assistant surgeon. He
hated to leave New York, to say nothing of us, but he
felt that was not a chance to be missed. Well, there he
was, pegging away, when what do you think happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How on earth should I know?” asked Gita crossly.
“Do come to the point. I always read the last page of
a story first, and you might have given me the climax
as a starter and told me his biography later. I suppose
he married a rich patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he. He’s worked too hard and he’s too much in
love with his profession to have a thought to spare for
women. No. A great surgeon, one of the greatest in
New York, Dr. Gaunt, under whom he had served for
a time in France, was visiting the hospital and saw him
perform an operation on a miner who had been smashed
up in a fashion more complicated than usual. Dr. Gaunt
was not only much impressed but remembered he had
thought Geoff uncommonly clever and resourceful when
they had worked together in one of the base hospitals.
He needed a young assistant, as the one he’d had for
some time had developed incipient tuberculosis and gone
to California. He asked Geoff to dinner that night, talked
with him for four hours, and then invited him to go to
New York. Of course Geoff clinched then and there.
When he descended on us this morning and told us the
story he said he still felt in a sort of daze. And of course
it means a good income from the beginning. Dr. Gaunt
will pay him a salary until he is assured of stepping into
the personal practice of the former associate, and he is
practically certain of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” said Gita temperately. “But I thought he had
discovered a gold-mine at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old stuff. I shouldn’t have liked that at all. But
I wish you’d warm up. Don’t you see what it means
to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Gita sprang to her feet with a little squeal of
delight. “Of course! It means you won’t have to work
any more and can devote all your time to writing.” She
did not kiss Elsie as another girl would have done, but
seized her hand and pumped it up and down. “Now
I am excited. It’s too wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, my dear. After I had got over being
exultant for Geoff and he had told me to go straight to
the store and hand in my resignation, I’m bound to say
I forgot him and was filled with an entirely personal excitement.
I never felt so happy in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think so. I know what it is to be free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Elsie’s flushed face and sparkling eyes
and wondered if the young author had what was known
as temperament and had been severely repressing it. She
was as curious about the secret places of the ego as Elsie
herself. “I suppose you’ll give yourself up to an orgy
of writing now,” she said. “Get to work on that novel
and be famous this time next year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll write it anyhow. Oh!” Elsie sprang to her feet
and lifted her arms. The color left her face and it glowed
with a white radiance. “Oh! To know that I may have
a career! A career! Whether you fail or set the world
on fire cannot make so very much difference if only you
have the opportunity to try for it, to work for it, to think
of nothing else! And to be able to write constantly without
interruption. You cannot imagine what it means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I can,” said Gita sharply. “And it makes me feel
like ten cents. I went to work in the garden this morning
because I had nothing to do. I’m sick of the Boardwalk,
and I can’t read all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie came down from the empyrean and regarded her
charge anxiously. “You’re not getting bored? You!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who wouldn’t be, in this house all alone? I think
I’d have enjoyed it if you and Polly hadn’t put a lot of
ideas into my head, for then I’d have been full of my new
independence and freedom from sordid worries, and I
always wanted to put in a lot of reading——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you ungrateful little beast! I could shake
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry. I shouldn’t have said that, and of course that
wouldn’t have lasted either. And of course I understand
myself. I used to get a lot of gratification out of brooding
and glooming. No doubt it’s that I miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! As long as you are honest with yourself you
won’t come to much harm. But you’d have ended by being
a sulky old maid—or worse. Stable endocrines can
be unbalanced in time. But I should think your hours
would be pretty well filled. You have this house to run,
you ride, walk, swim, read, and see a good deal of your
friends. Later, New York will be furiously interesting.
I really don’t see what you have to complain of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what does it all lead to? It’s all very well for
you to be in love with life and dance about and spread
your wings. You’ve a gift, and a career in prospect—full
of variety and suspense. The truth of the matter is, I
suppose, that my nature craves drama. In a way I’ve had
it all my life. Damn ugly drama, most of it. But with
all sorts of climaxes and uncertainties, and a tremendous
amount of personal effort and strife. D’you think I’m cut
out for a society woman, a lady of the manor? Just about
as much as I’m cut out for a husband and babies. Just
about!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Gita! Surely you are enjoying this new life of
yours? And you do fit it, and you do manage to get a
great deal out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, that’s true enough. I only go off at a tangent
once in a while. But, you see, I’ve done hard thinking
all my life, and I simply can’t help wondering every
now and again what I’ll do when the novelty has entirely
worn off and I’m bored stiff. I’m not really bored yet.
Just looking ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, just remind yourself that you are now in a position
to command a good deal of novelty. This is only
the prologue. Life takes care of the changes when one
is free on the surface, not burrowing in one of the ruts.
Even then things have been known to happen. Of course
you’ll never fall in love (something she was not at all
sure of; but she was wiser than Polly who had “trotted
out” three young men for Gita’s inspection, and been
“treated like a dog” for her pains), so you’ll probably miss
the most exciting experience of all. But <span class='sc'>LIFE</span>, when you
are fairly launched in it! Oh, wait, my dear! Just
wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shrugged her shoulders. “I’m waiting! All you
say sounds very fine but it’s just glittering generalities.
However—I <span class='it'>am</span> ungrateful and I’ll think no more about
it. You’ll stay to lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elsie rose and put on her hat. “Not today. Tomorrow,
if you’ll have me. But this is Geoff’s first day
at home in over a year. I wish you’d dine with us tonight.
Can’t you forget that Geoff is a man and merely
think of him as my brother? After all, when you come
out you’ll have to meet endless men, and talk to them,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita gave her a hard stare. “If I thought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” Elsie gave her rippling laugh. “I’m no
matchmaker, and if I were you’d be the last person on
earth whose love-destiny I’d dare have a hand in. I’m
not sure you’ll even tolerate Geoff because he’s my
brother. I don’t know what he may have done in his
off moments but I do know that women don’t interest him
and he makes no effort to talk to them. He’s rather silent,
even with us. Carving up someone in his mind, I suppose.
But I’d like to have you meet him, simply because he is
my brother, and you, my dear, have become a part of
my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita kissed her for the first time. It was a peck, but
it meant as much, Elsie knew, as the remark that followed.
“I’ll come, of course, and I’ll try not to hate
him.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Elsie</span> had never been able to refurnish her old house,
but she could have pink lights in the dining-room, and a
bowl of pink roses on the table to draw attention from
the worn linen and serviceable plates. Colored servants
had long since relieved Mrs. Pelham of the “fine china”
and Bohemian glass of palmier days. The simple platters
and vegetable-dishes were of indestructible silver and she
polished them herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, whose table was overloaded with massive silver,
fit only for a banquet hall, and who had dropped one of
the forks on a priceless dish, the fragments removed by
a muttering Topper, felt a sharp pang of homesickness:
she was reminded of her mother’s pathetic attempts to
give beauty to the homeliest surroundings, if the result
were but a bowl of wild flowers or a worn but embroidered
kimono thrown over the bald sofa of a pension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a third at the table, for Geoffrey Pelham had
met a friend on the Boardwalk and brought him home.
Neither of the men wore evening clothes, but Mrs. Pelham,
whose austere face shone with a light that seemed
to Gita nothing less than miraculous, wore her best black
satin (by no means the soft and clinging fabric of fashion),
bordered at the neck and wrists with Irish lace.
Elsie’s gown of “Caribbean blue” deepened the hue of
her eyes, and the revealed pedestal of her neck gave her
head and throat a more girlish beauty. She looked barely
twenty and her cheeks were very pink, her eyes very
bright. Gita, acutely conscious of her own bare neck and
arms, with a rosy glow on their ivory surfaces, tried to
concentrate her mind on the excellent food, and answered
in monosyllables the occasional remarks addressed to
her. It was the first dinner she had attended for over
three years, and in San Francisco she had persisted, despite
Millicent’s tears, in wearing uncomely little dark
frocks with elbow-sleeves and a neck curve that fitted
the base of her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversational ball rolled between Elsie Brewster
and Eustace Bylant. Mrs. Pelham merely beamed on
her son, who devoted himself to his dinner and rarely volunteered
a remark. Gita, who was appreciative of good
looks, however grudgingly she might admit their waste,
and whose eyelashes were an effective screen for subtle
observation, remarked that Geoffrey Pelham had the hard
outlines of his mother redeemed by a keen intellectual
life of their own, and a high head with an abundance of
fair hair, properly cut at the back but indifferently
brushed. His eyes, like Elsie’s, were gray-blue but darker,
widely and deeply set; and he showed his battle with fortune,
his ambition, and his devotion to his chosen science
in a certain set grimness of mouth and nostril. His tall
figure had the look of recent affinity with a uniform, an
expression even doctors brought back from the war. But
although Gita inferred he might be found attractive by
women if sufficiently responsive, she dismissed this gift
as negligible and concentrated her admiration for a moment
on his brow. Like his sister’s it was high and full
and had the same expression of intellectual nobility.
Probably no lie, as she’d tested out Elsie.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Below the
eyebrows the face was that of a man whose natural expression
might have been nervous, eager, sensitive, but
trained to constant and severe repression. A man of a
single purpose, no doubt of that. Well, surgery could
have him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her eyelashes on Mr. Bylant, who was still
talking to Elsie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace Bylant was a novelist of considerable distinction,
thirty-eight in years, and admittedly the bridge
across the chasm that divided the “younger generation,”
which had brought a new if somewhat strident note into
American fiction, and the stable group that went its
serene way based firmly on the traditions of England.
His own base was as firm as England’s Gibraltar, but his
undiminished curiosity, the activity of his mind, and his
genuine interest in current life and thought, enabled him
without effort to be as modern as the youngsters. Sometimes
more so, for the youngsters were often ingenuously
mediæval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his religion was art, words his flexible tools; he
could create a living picture of dire offensiveness without
an offensive word. An inexorable realist, he scorned to
introduce beauty where beauty was not, but when forced
by the exigencies of the story to create an unclean interior
inhabited by persons who declined to wash, he conveyed
his meaning so craftily that the reader was uncomfortably
aware of an assortment of smells and raucous
sounds and ugly images, which he remembered long
after dismissing the grease and grime and stenches of
less accomplished recorders of life at its worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant had never made an effort to repress the mobile
play of his features and looked less than his thirty-eight
years, in spite of the fact that he was a bright light at
sophisticate parties when they did not interfere with his
work. His long nose was sharp and investigating, his
mouth would have been sensuous but for an almost rigid
firmness of the lower lip, and his lively gray eyes sparkled
with tolerance and good-humor. He wore an infinitesimal
mustache and a short pointed beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was always meticulously groomed and radiated good
health; his large firm hands were as carefully tended as
a fastidious woman’s, although he was as masculine as
Geoffrey Pelham and something of an athlete. Gita, who,
in her worst days, had polished her nails, compared the
hands of the two men. Dr. Pelham’s were long and sensitive
and flexible, but no doubt he thought it sufficient to
keep them clean and disinfected and wasted no time on a
buffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had arrived early by request, spent half an hour
in Elsie’s bedroom, and listened none too patiently to a
brief biography of the distinguished guest. “I’ve not
seen so very much of him, considering he’s a great friend
of my brother,” Elsie had rattled on, “but he always
calls when he comes to Atlantic City; sometimes drops
in on me at the office. And I’ve met him at a few parties
in New York. He’s known from the first that I am the
occasional Elizabeth Pelham of the magazines. Shortly
after my début as ‘E. B.’ he introduced me to Suzan
Forbes, who took me firmly by the hand and steered
me into the haven of the Lucy Stone League, where
cognominal transitions from father to husband are sternly
tabu. Do I look all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had assured her she looked lovely, and they had
gone downstairs arm in arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aloof and apparently absorbed in her “Maryland
chicken,” she wondered apprehensively if Bylant were in
love with Elsie and decided he was not. His eyes were
merely bright with interest as they discussed current tendencies
and sophisticate personalities. He had darted a
curious glance at herself once or twice in the parlor, and
there had been a sudden glow in his eyes when they were
introduced that made her stiffen her spine—that unfailing
thermometer of her moods—but he had favored her with
his notice no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point it occurred to her that she was acting
like a “cub.” In San Francisco, where she had been invited
to dinners by girls who both liked and pitied her,
eccentricities were condoned and they had expected no
help at her hands. Tonight she was not only the guest
of honor but the only other girl present, and—she made
a wild dive among the shades of her ancestors—she was
Miss Carteret of Carteret Manor. She may have accepted
the rôle under protest but accepted it she had, and to behave
like a sulky outlaw and cast a shade over the feast
would no longer be tolerated. Elsie loved her and if she
were disappointed would give no sign, but Gita imagined
with a shudder the cold disapproval of Mrs. Pleyden if she
sat like a sphinx at her table with a picked man on
either side to entertain. She might as well begin now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Dr. Pelham and asked a tentative question,
imbecile, she admitted, but she hardly could be
expected to scintillate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you glad to be home, to have seen the last of the
West?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pelham smiled slightly. “Oh, I rather liked Butte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mining town, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather.” He was in no mood for small talk, for his
mind was full of his suddenly dazzling future, but he
recognized that he was host, and if this hitherto agreeably
silent guest were suddenly inspired to conversation, it
was his duty to humor her. “A very noisy town. There
are three shifts, you know, and groups of miners on the
street corners at all hours of the day and night. The
city never seems to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather trying for those who want to sleep, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decidedly. But I was generally too tired at night to
be kept awake even by the eternally bouncing trucks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned to him squarely. She felt no repulsion toward
individual men as long as they were impersonal,
and Butte roused her curiosity. At the same moment Dr.
Pelham was enabled to observe that she had the largest
and fiercest black eyes he had ever seen and quite the
most remarkable eyelashes. “Please tell me something
about Butte,” she said eagerly. “I have lived in a good
many places but never in a mining town. I always
thought I’d like to go to Johannesburg, but I never heard
of Butte until today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The two cities are said to be much alike.” And he
launched into a description of the stark hill, once known
as Perch of the Devil, for unarguable reasons, where the
inhabitants walked over copper-mines a mile in depth
and sometimes found outcroppings in their back yards.
He was grateful to her for introducing a subject which
cost him no effort, and he had been able to see the
beauty as well as the smiting ugliness of that ore-scorched
region. In winter when the high valley was covered with
snow it had a cold loveliness of its own, particularly
under the blue dawn of Montana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That phrase had occurred to him as he walked home
before sunrise one morning after a call to The Flat to
patch up a woman so severely injured in an amorous
dispute that it was impossible to move her. His sentences
were brief and unadorned but it seemed to Gita
that she had a complete vision of that unique “camp”
in the Rocky Mountains with its sinister and unsleeping
life underground and its scarred and feverish surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go there some day,” she said, and not merely
to be polite. “It would be a new sensation to telephone
to New York in a comfortable office a mile underground.”
Bylant and Elsie had fallen silent and were listening,
the latter with intense approval: Geoffrey was exerting
himself to entertain a woman, and Gita was hanging on
his words. Then she frowned. <span class='it'>That</span> would be too obvious.
One’s darling brother and beloved friend. Old stuff.
Wouldn’t do, anyhow. What Geoff needed was a good
old-fashioned wife to see that he got proper food at
regular hours, and soothing and sufficiently intelligent
conversation when at home. Whatever else Gita might
become she never would be soothing and adaptable. Eustace
Bylant might manage her. But the distinguished
author had not manifested the slightest interest in this
transitional friend of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she became aware that while leaning toward
Geoffrey, Bylant was covertly watching Gita Carteret.
There was a curious expression in his eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very
curious. Not admiration; that would have been natural
enough. Not even speculation—more natural still. Not
dubiety. Gita, now that she had abandoned a hopeless
pose, more especially when she wore soft and luminous
satin and a rope of shimmering pearls, did not look in
the least like a boy. She was still more handsome than
beautiful, perhaps, for there was no trace of softness in
her spirited features, and had it not been for her eyelashes
she would have resembled too closely the eagle-like countenance
of Mrs. Carteret.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His eyes had not even
their “psychological look,” as when he was visibly admiring
and inwardly impaling some elated woman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No,
it was—it was—Elsie almost lost her breath as the expression
in Bylant’s eyes deepened to an inner certainty.
Expectancy? Hope? She had watched it dawn out of a
stare of keen appraisement, as if his critical faculty were
determined to make no mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw him shrug his shoulders, shift his gaze,
and give his full attention to Geoffrey. A few moments
later, to his friend’s manifest relief, he took over the
burden of conversation and talked of old and abandoned
mining towns he had seen in Nevada; and told stories
both orthodox and unusual, that clung to them. One made
even Gita laugh heartily; the tale of a man who had
taken refuge in the office of his manager high up and in
the side of a mountain still full of silver, which could
be approached only by a narrow and precarious flight
of steps—from a lady of easy virtue, who, now that he
owned much of the mountain, was determined to marry
him. While he was smoking a congratulatory pipe his
manager, passing the entrance to the eyrie, cried out
suddenly: “My God, Jim, she’s coming up the ladder
with a pistol in one hand and a priest behind her!” And,
corralled and at bay, the millionaire had married the lady,
dowered her extravagantly, and left her to her own devices.
A few years later she had attained a high and
haughty position in European Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Bylant included Gita in the conversation as
he did Mrs. Pelham; with equal and charming politeness,
and nothing more. She went home with the sense
of having had an agreeable and instructive evening, and
of enjoying it more than she deserved. Far more important,
she had pleased Elsie and was not compelled to
anathematize herself as a boor. Topper had been ordered
to call for her in a taxi, lest Elsie should insist upon her
brother’s escort. Dr. Pelham, much relieved, pronounced
her a sensible young woman, and looked astonished when
his sister went off into a paroxysm of laughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> was walking in her woods. She had had a canter
on the beach and a swim and was full of exultant life.
The mood of two mornings earlier was forgotten. It was
glorious to be young and free from care and as healthy
and lively as a puppy. In these days, thank heaven,
the young were consciously young; no one could say
they did not appreciate their youth till too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had come into the wood because there was no one
to see her if she looked as pagan as she felt, and she
loved these beautiful silent pines more than any of her
possessions. Occasionally she danced, and kicked the
pine-needles and fallen cones about. Elsie had forbidden
her to whistle and engrave lines about her mouth, but she
answered the trills of the birds with sharp little cries
almost as ecstatic. She wondered if she had been a dryad
in a former incarnation, or (her self-analytical habit
always kept pace with her imagination) if she were
merely being young for the first time; she could not
recall feeling young even in her childhood. She also
wondered if she would ever have been unhappy, even
under the shadow of Gerald Carteret, if they had lived
in the country. “The Peninsula” below San Francisco
had been far too decorated and populous to be real country
and the desert was a region set aside for lost souls.
But in these pine woods with their brooding but intimate
silences, their pungent fragrance, and lovely solitudes,
she had a sense of both space and friendliness, of stateliness
and simplicity, vastly different, she imagined, from
the mighty forests of California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they were hers! She had never taken even Elsie
into them. She had a fancy that these straight slender
trees had, perhaps a million years ago, lived as men and
women, whose souls had passed finally into a form more
beautiful than Nature had granted to mortals, and fortunately
inarticulate; but that they recognized her as an
old playmate and sheltered her jealously when she found
her joy in their shade. She picked up a cone and flung it
into the arbors above, resenting even the presence of a
squirrel in her secret domain, and gave a whoop of delight
as he scampered angrily across his branch into another
tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she came face to face with Eustace Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look like a wood-nymph,” he said, lifting his hat
and undisconcerted by the fierce blaze of her eyes. “For
a moment I hesitated to break the spell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was speechless with amazement and wrath. She
felt an impulse to chase him out of her sacred wood as
she would a stray cat from her bedroom. Then she remembered
her manners and said with bitter politeness:
“Good morning. You startled me, but this is the first
time I have ever met anyone in my woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they yours? I beg your pardon. New Jersey is
covered with woods and one gets into the habit of thinking
of them—well, as just woods. And I happen to be
very fond of woods. But I am really sorry,” he added
contritely. “You looked so happy a moment ago—happier
than any mere mortal has a right to look.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
I think I understand. I’ll go if you insist——” He broke
off and looked about him at the sweet deep aisles of the
wood with an expression of longing in his fine eyes that
seemed to have eliminated herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spell was broken and the creature was a friend of
Elsie’s. “Oh, well, as you are here you may as well stay,”
she said with no attempt at graciousness. “But I must
go in presently. I have business letters to write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please! Business letters! What a horrible
thought. How could it enter your head in these woods?
If they were mine I doubt if I should write a line except
when they were dripping in winter: I have a holy horror
of rheumatism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strolled beside her, his hands in the pockets of his
riding-coat, his hat pushed to the back of his head. He
had come to the wood deliberately to meet her, casually
if possible, and find her off guard, and he had been rewarded
by a full glimpse of something he had half suspected
two nights ago. She had haunting memories for
him and he was determined to study her, possibly to
marry her. He smiled to himself as he reflected that the
first thought of another man no doubt would be to awaken
the womanhood so perversely sleeping in this girl who
seemed to be unconscious that sex ruled the world, but
he was on a different track. He had extracted something
of her history from Elsie Brewster after Gita had
left them, and more from Polly Pleyden, with whom
he had dined on the following night. But the information
had been sought less out of sheer masculine curiosity than
as a means for determining his tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita nodded sullenly. She had behaved uncommonly
well, she told herself, but if he were unable to take a
hint nothing further could be expected of her. A man
in her woods! Men, individually, were not worth hating
as long as they behaved themselves, but her indifference
when they did was entire. This creature did not look
predatory and his cool impersonal gaze aroused in her
no sense of wary disquiet. She walked straight and
silent beside him and he talked of the dinner at the
Pleydens’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly was rather huffed when I told her I had met
you at the Pelhams’,” he said. “It seems you have
refused to dine with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My grandmother has only been dead three months.
Polly knows quite well I don’t go out. Dining with Elsie
is another matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so. But I am delighted to hear that your
period of mourning will end in the winter and you will
visit the Pleydens in New York.” There was no emphasis
in his cool quiet tones and he appeared merely
to be making conversation. Gita wondered impatiently
why he didn’t go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I shall have to visit them for a week or
two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah? Mrs. Pleyden said she expected you to spend
the winter with them. It seems she had some understanding
with your grandmother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” Gita’s voice sounded such genuine alarm
that he glanced about the woods once more with a smile
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita warmed to him for a moment. “If I’ve got to
be introduced to this Eastern Society I’ve got to, I suppose,
but I shall live here and only go to New York
occasionally. And I’ll not be invited to parties because
I don’t dance. I don’t fancy I’ll be run after for dinners
either. I wish I were rich enough to have an apartment
in town to spend half the week in. I do want to
go to the opera and all the new plays. But my lawyer
says I must be careful for a year or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you rent the manor? I fancy there are
a good many of the backgroundless on the lookout for
an incongruous setting. They would give you a fancy
price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shook her head vigorously. “I did think of it
once but I never could do it now. It’s too much mine
in too many ways. It seems to have a soul of its own,
a distillation of all the Carterets, perhaps. I could as
easily have rented out my grandmother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant laughed heartily. He had a mellow laugh and it
struck no false note in the wood. “I have heard a good
deal of Mrs. Carteret and I fancy your old manor house
would appreciate the compliment. I understand exactly
what you mean, for I too have an old house—in Albany—and
my mother would not live anywhere else. She
insisted that old houses, particularly old family mansions,
had a very real and complex personality, made up not
only of those who had lived there—the direct inheritors
and the diverse strains introduced by marriage—but
because the windows, she said, were so many eyes looking
out on history in the process of making; the family ghost,
perhaps, recording it all in the invisible volumes that
atmosphere shares with the subconsciousness of man.
An old house must have an atmospheric library as extensive
as the British Museum, and could hardly fail to
have a personality. My mother—Bladina, I called her,
for, although she was the consummate mother, she seemed
little older than myself—used to say that if anything
could convert her to spiritualism it would be the hope
of making her old walls speak; the house was built by
a Dutch ancestor when Albany was Fort Orange and
she refused to leave it when she married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was regarding him with interested eyes. “How
odd!” she exclaimed. “I’ve been feeling just like that
lately. Been reading a history of New Jersey; and my
old manor must have accumulated tomes. Primeval wilderness
and Indians. Dutch—West India Company.
Swedes. English. Dutch once more. English again.
Constant disputes between governors and between East
and West New Jersey before they were reunited. Always
on the verge of war with New England. Jealousies,
heart-burnings, shattered careers. Governors who oppressed
and provoked the people to rebellion, and one who
‘dressed himself in a woman’s habit and patrolled his
fort.’ Quakers. Witches. Lords Proprietors. Negro
risings, and negro slaves burned alive for assault. Then
the American Revolution; there was a good deal of fighting
around here. And all the rest. And the Carterets
lived a wild life of their own. My baronial hall, as the
historian calls it, has an aloof, brooding, almost intolerably
self-satisfied air, as if it knew so much more than
any mere mortal could ever learn. It is quite haughtily
reserved and withdrawn and only condescends to me
because I was born a Carteret. But it really makes me
feel more at home than I ever felt anywhere else, and
I’d starve before I’d have its atmosphere damaged by
aliens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand. I understand—perfectly.” He had
turned a little pale, but he continued to regard her with
eyes that evinced mere friendly interest. And as he
had evidently been as devoted to his mother as she to
poor Millicent, and as he had without conscious effort
made her talk freely, and understood her at that, she
decided—particularly as there seemed to be no prospect
of getting rid of him—to tolerate him for the morning
at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m rather tired,” she said. “Let’s sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to the edge of the pool, an oval sheet
of water in the heart of the wood, so densely surrounded
by pines that their branches were reflected in the water
and there was hardly room to sit on the turf. She propped
herself against a tree and he selected one close by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said, “tell me more of your mother. What
did she look like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much like you,” said Bylant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>For</span> a moment Gita felt more angry than astonished,
and half rose. Then she settled back with a laugh.
“Someone’s mother is the very last—— Was she any
relation of the Carterets?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of, but types are not confined to
families.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t at all like being told I belong to a type.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But everyone does, my dear child.” Bylant smiled
indulgently as he took out his pipe. “It is the common
lot, although nothing distresses the ego more than to be
reminded of it. But it is type accentuated, raised to the
nth degree, that makes the individual. You are like
my mother in certain respects, in others not at all, and
yet you are the only person I have ever met who reminded
me of her. If you had been brought up here
at Carteret Manor the resemblance would be more striking
still, but the plus and the minus make you yourself
and no one else. Don’t writhe under the apprehension that
your exact counterpart exists anywhere else in the world!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the other hand, if the conditions had been reversed,
I don’t doubt that my mother would have been,
at your age, almost precisely what you are today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had been introduced to a new sensation. Titillated
vanity conquered pique. She had heard of the none too
subtle methods of the American male and eyed Bylant
warily, then concluded he was harmless, and smiled encouragingly.
“I suppose, on the whole, I should be flattered,”
she said. “And your mother seems to have been
one of the individuals. How was she brought up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the most orthodox manner possible. A beautiful
high-spirited intelligent girl, she was educated partly in
France, partly in New York, and came out inevitably at
eighteen. She had a winter of intoxicating belledom and
then married my father, who was her complement in
looks, being even lighter than I am, had that air of intense
reserve that suggests unfathomable depths, and the
most charming manners. It was blind surrender to the
race-urge with the mental accompaniment of an infant
rooting in the proper place for nourishment. All the
old-timers are horrified at this new license of young people,
but at least they will avoid one mistake of their
forerunners. They know exactly what is the matter with
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The marriage was not a happy one. My father was
dull, stubborn, and had ideas as orthodox as himself on
the subject of home rule. He was thrown from his horse
and killed when I was seven. After that she devoted
herself entirely to me—her parents died soon after she
married—and recovered all her old buoyancy and joy
of life. Of course she had other offers of marriage, and
many friends; but although she liked society and was too
sane to hate an entire sex because one man had failed
her, she was too happy in her freedom and her child
to be tempted for a moment. She entertained enough
to give the atmosphere of my home a certain gayety and
to initiate me into the ways of the minor world. I went
to boarding-school when the proper time came, for she
was too wise to run the risk of feminizing me, but I
spent my vacations with her—we traveled a good deal—and
when I left Harvard and returned home with the
intention of adopting the profession of letters, she became
my constant companion and spoiled me for anyone
else. She had a wide range of interests, in life as well
as in books—in which she had taken refuge during my
father’s régime—and magnificent spirits——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, those I haven’t got, at all events. I’ve felt blue
or cross most of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you dancing in the woods. You looked sixteen—no,
ageless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your spirits were in constant conflict
with your luck and boiled over into the wrong channels.
If you had been commonplace your unhappy experience
would have made little impression on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it made a lot, and if you care to hear it I’ll
tell you something about my own mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned over and emptied the ashes of his pipe
into the lake. When he turned to her his eyes were
bright and his cheeks flushed, but his expression betrayed
nothing more than kindly interest. “Please do,”
he said warmly. “One confidence deserves another. I’ve
heard scraps—you are a much-discussed young person,
you know—and I’m keen to hear the story at first hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not put me in a book!” There was a very
faint note of alarm in her voice, and she experienced
another titillation at the possibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you really do not want to be ‘put in a book’ you
are even more original than you look. But suppose we
defer introducing anything so extraneous to the moment
as fiction? I certainly should not take such a liberty
without your consent after you had given me your confidence.
Just now I am only interested in discovering
what has made you so different from Bladina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This subtle touch completed the conquest of Gita’s
jealous reserve. To her increasing amazement she found
herself unburdening her soul of the poisonous accumulations
of her twenty-two years. She told the chronicle
from the beginning, omitting no detail, extrinsic or subjective.
If she paused to remind herself that she was
breaking the habit of a lifetime and turning herself inside
out—to a man! Of all things!—she concluded that an
author was much the same as a father confessor, but
more appreciative of high-lights; she knew that she was
telling an interesting story and telling it well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant, overwhelmingly interested in her both as a
man and an ardent psychologist, was quite aware of her
attitude toward himself, and although the man in him
rebelled, for he was more in love with her every moment,
he consoled himself with the pregnant certainty that he
was her first confidant; and, whether she resented the
act later or not, she was creating an indissoluble bond.
It was a long first step and he knew the virtue of
patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita’s indifference to anything below the intellectual
dome of her new friend was complete. She felt
buoyant and released, as if she had suddenly been hauled
out of a dungeon and introduced to light and freedom,
and she felt grateful and quite willing to take him on as a
doctor. He had certainly purged her soul. To talk about
herself after all these years of repression had been almost
ecstatic and she knew she had committed the wisest act
of her life. But she concluded on a light note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, you’ve had it all! Not a pretty story, is it?
And you must be thankful I’m not your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you hadn’t been her psychological—and physiological—twin
your story would have been very different
and you wouldn’t have told it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> glanced at her wrist-watch and sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quarter past one! My old Topper will be wringing
his hands. He’s served meals on time for fifty years
and privately thinks me a disgrace to the Carterets because
I hate regular hours and strew my things all over
the house. You must come back to lunch with me. I’ve
an excellent cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant dusted the pine-needles from his trousers. “I
won’t be gallant and vow that a luncheon of bread and
cheese in your company would be a feast for the gods,
for I’m both hungry and highly appreciative of good
cooking; and this is a morning sternly devoted to truth.
I’ll come with the greatest pleasure in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tone was gay and matter-of-fact, but Gita received
the subtle message that super-formalities existed between
them no longer. She shrugged her shoulders. Well, she
had done the inconceivable. Why not take on a man
friend for a change? And an author-man, at least, was
far more understanding and stimulating, when it came
to real conversation, than any woman she had known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon they sat in the library, and for a time
in silence, Bylant enjoying his cigar, his eyes roving
appreciatively over the walls of books. It was a completely
satisfying relic of the past, that old manor library,
collected by men who had been intellectual in their own
ponderous way; and an inimitable background for this
spirited, rebellious, neoteric descendant who had inherited
their handsome high-bred shell and cast out their
prejudices, packing the space with idiosyncrasies of her
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita followed his glance. “Those old tomes are pretty
dull,” she said with a sigh. “But I learned something
of the history of each of the countries I lived in—France,
Belgium, Germany, Italy; we were even in England
once for a few months—and it is time I knew more.
I’m frightfully ignorant. I like history and biographies
better than anything, but I must say it’s rather hard
to lose oneself in musty pages covered with brown spots
like freckles, and long esses. I don’t believe a Carteret
bought a book later than 1830. But I peg away at it
for two hours every evening, and on rainy days I yawn
over them by the hour. I’ve made a virtuous resolution
not to read a novel for six months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send you some of the modern histories and biographies.
They are equally—perhaps more—authentic,
and their writers belong to this generation of the quick
and are more fearful of dullness than of crime. Dullness
is a crime, for that matter, for it has slaughtered more
brains than excess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had no intention of discussing books with her.
It should be another bond between them in the future
and the fertile cause of frequent association; but the
mood of the morning was still on her, her intoxicated
ego still danced in those magnificent eyes, and he needed
little adroitness to lead her to enlarge upon certain incidents
of her past which, he protested, she had brushed
aside too lightly to satisfy a greedy psychologist. Gita
was not slow to understand that she was the most interesting
study that had ever swum within the ken of this
multifariously experienced novelist, and she rose to the
bait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also gave her a more detailed account of his own
life, particularly before the sudden death of his mother
eight years ago; and if, when they finally parted, she
did not feel that she knew him better, and he her, than
anyone either of them had known in this life of many
acquaintances and few friends, it was, he told himself
grimly, through no fault of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll see me again in a day or two,” he said as they
shook hands in the garden, whither they had migrated
as the sun rode to the west. “I’m going to New York
tomorrow to make a choice selection among my books
for your delectation. May I bring them over on Friday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to lunch if you like. It’s been very jolly and
I’ll always be glad to see you—with or without the books.”
Gita produced what she called her manor-manners without
effort. This author-man had chased away the black
clouds that always muttered on the horizon even when
they did not overwhelm her and she felt intensely grateful
to him. She liked him better than Elsie or Polly and
he would be as little likely to make love to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt an impulse to ask her to meet him in the
wood, but decided it would be a failure in tactics, and
merely replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall take advantage of your hospitality very often.
I came to Atlantic City to get rid of a cold and have taken
rooms in Chelsea for a month. But the life here has
never interested me and I’ll look upon you as the best of
good fellows if you’ll let me come often to this delightful
old manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The door is always open, for Topper and I disagree
on the subject of fresh air and burglars. As they used
to say in California in the old Spanish days, ‘The house
is yours. Burn it if you will.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they both laughed, and parted, well pleased with
themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, who, to use his own word, had pestered Mr.
Donald for money to refurnish her house, had announced
some time since that she had changed her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the house has changed it for me,” she
thought; she condescended to no explanation to her
lawyer, whom she delighted in tormenting. “I’ve an idea
its walls would fall in if I took too many liberties with
its sacred traditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now that the more anachronistic of the furnishings
had been banished (what-nots, rep sets with antimacassars,
walnut writing-desks, hat-racks, marble-topped tables,
chiffoniers, commodes, ottomans, Victorian horsehair),
and fresh air had exorcised the mustiness she had
found so depressing, there was no question that tulipwood
and hickory, spindle-legs and mahogany, carved
oak and pewter, Sheraton and Windsor, lady-made tapestry,
threadbare velvet, brocade and damask, however little
they might harmonize one with the other, were as
much a part of the historic old mansion as the family
portraits; and nothing she could buy in New York or
Philadelphia, even if she confined herself to “period”
shops, would take their place. Like the walls they had
been the mute companions of nearly three centuries of
Carterets; and Gita, sitting on one of the faded chairs
in the drawing-room, sometimes fancied there was a
knowing smile on the lips of her grandmother’s portrait,
painted shortly after she came to the manor as a bride,
and smiled in unwilling response as she remembered one
of her last conversations with the redoubtable old lady.
She had surrendered to the house, no doubt of that.
She had despised ancestral traditions as long as they had
given her nothing, had been a convinced democrat, with
leanings toward socialism, as long as she was a quasi-derelict;
but now that she possessed an adequate and independent
income, inherited from her line with one of
the most historic old properties in America, she felt as
if she were being reëducated in silent communion with
every Carteret that had lived here before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were family portraits all over the lower floor,
and their painted unchanging faces had become as familiar
to her as those of her lively and excessively modern
young friends; she sat in the twilight and tried to visualize
that long and vanished line that had contributed
to the personality of the house even if their shades did
not return to haunt it. She had no fear of ghosts and
would have liked to see her Carterets moving about their
old habitat in the picturesque costumes of their eras.
The only ghost that would have frightened her was her
too-recent grandmother’s, and if her father had stood
before her she would have shrieked her dismay. She
sincerely hoped his discarnate self was permanently
impaled in a roasting pit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the old house had got her! It was remaking her
in a way, and at this conclusion she sometimes rebelled.
She had looked upon Gita Carteret as a crystallized and
unique individuality, and to be reconstructed by a combination
of circumstances and ghosts gave her ego some
intemperate moments; but finally she reasoned that as
everyone was the sum of his ancestors, what she was
developing into had really composed the foundations of
her being, and was now enjoying its first opportunity
to express itself. If she had been brought up at Carteret
Manor, as her grandmother had insinuated, she would
have been a Carteret to her still recalcitrant spine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While drawing these wise conclusions she quite forgot
poor Millicent, who, after all, had contributed, both by
blood and counsel, a modicum of sweetness and adaptability—to
say nothing of good manners when Gita chose
to use them. No Carteret had ever been called adaptable
or sweet. Their grim handsome hard faces were of men—and
women—whom life had favored not chastened, and
had bred out less powerful cross-strains necessarily introduced
by marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had forgotten Eustace Bylant almost as soon as
he had left her; forgot him as promptly after each subsequent
visit; or, if he drifted across her memory, it
was merely as a sympathetic and instructive mind, whose
devotion to his mother had struck a responsive chord,
and then delivered her own of its burden. As a man
he was non-existent. Although she analyzed herself ruthlessly
and as often as occasion demanded, on sex, either
in herself or other women, she had never wasted a
thought. She might resent being a “female,” but as to
what it involved aside from its disabilities was no concern
of hers. She had read enough to know that some women
went through life as frigid as the disembodied, and she
concluded, when she thought about the matter at all,
that she belonged in their class. Odd if she did not,
with her springs poisoned before they had reached the
surface. Anyhow, it was one more matter for congratulation
and pointed the wings of her freedom.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Polly strolled in on her one day when she was standing
before the portrait of her grandmother, whimsically making
faces at the intolerant beauty who had harbored no
doubts of <span class='sc'>HER</span> place in the general scheme, and laughed
aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you stick your tongue out at her?” she
asked. “I often wanted to when I was a kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita whirled, frowning. “I didn’t hear you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad you didn’t. Caught another glimpse of your
innards. Eustace Bylant would express it more stylistically,
no doubt. Hear you’ve been seeing a lot of him
lately. What’s happened? Thought you’d no use for
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s brought me some books—jolly good ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’s a man, my dear. A two-legged, upstanding,
at least eighty-eight-per-cent man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he?” asked Gita indifferently. “What has that
to do with it? I remember I told you once I’d no objection
to talking to intelligent men as long as they behaved
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s a sly old fox, but I’ll wager this is the first
time he’s had to hold in and lay siege. Siege is generally
on the other side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk rot. He thinks I need educating, and I
certainly do. He might be a forty-per-cent as far as
I’m concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly looked at her sharply, then laughed. “Poor
Eustace! However, life, to say nothing of our own sweet
sex, has treated him well. It would take a good deal
to discourage him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a crashing bore. You look lovely. Why
don’t blondes always wear pale yellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it?” Polly spun on her heel. She wore a woven
silk sport suit and untrimmed felt hat of yellow the
shade of her hair and looked not unlike a canary. “You’d
be wonderful in yellow yourself and I long for the time
when you’ll go into colors. I’ve thought out two gowns
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s eyes sparkled and her faint annoyance passed,
with all memory of Eustace Bylant. “I feel symptoms
of taking a frantic interest in dress and wish I were
rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’ve enough. Lots of the girls have to manage.
They’ve got hold of a little dressmaker lately who was
with Langdorf and Dana for years and has set up for herself.
She’ll dress you for hundreds where the old robbers
would charge you thousands. And as Mr. Donald is
dying to get rid of you he’ll not lecture you on extravagance—and
that brings me to the object of this morning
call. Mother is frightfully upset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she? What’s the matter with her?” Gita was sitting
on a low crinoline chair looking up at Polly, who
had begun to walk restlessly about the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have to come out with it, I suppose, as I offered to
take on the job. She hates scenes, and as for poor old
Donald——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scenes? What on earth are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—she and Mr. Donald had a long pow-wow yesterday,
and the upshot was they decided you must have
a chaperon-companion—and at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chaperon? I?” Gita sprang to her feet. “Are you
raving?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come now, Gita, you’ve seen a good deal of the
world, first and last. You know perfectly well that girls
of our sort don’t live alone. Neither mother nor Mr.
Donald thought it worth bothering about before, because
you were in mourning, and because—well, because you
were you. They never for a moment imagined you’d be
receiving young men alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not let him come here again. I shouldn’t care
if I never saw him again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Eustace! But the harm’s done, my dear. All
Chelsea is buzzing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your crowd, you mean! They’re nice ones to talk.
I thought they’d forgotten the meaning of the word chaperon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but we’d never live alone, my dear. To be
really free you must observe certain conventions just
as you must wear the proper clothes. Keep your background
intact and you may kick your slipper over the
moon. Think of all the rascality men get away with
so long as they keep within the law. Same idea. We’ll
have to find a respectable companion for you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you will not! I love living alone and doing just
as I please. And no companion would stay with me
a week, I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’d have a sweet time of it, no doubt of that.
But, Gita, remember you’re coming out next winter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll settle that right here. If I have to choose between
your stupid old Society and my complete independence
I won’t come out. I could get a lot more out of New
York, anyhow, by myself, and if I want to know people
Elsie will take me among the sophisticates. You know
perfectly well I’d be a failure in Society, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly was dismayed. She had watched the evolution
of Gita with satisfaction and mirth, and was convinced
that when she had shed the last of her bristles she
would be a regular girl; not quite like anyone else,
perhaps, but amenable. But this was taking freedom
altogether too seriously. She gathered her forces and
she was a hardy antagonist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know what will happen?” she demanded, seating herself
and lighting a cigarette. “The men of that sophisticate
crowd will feel they can insult you with impunity.
Pretty mixed crowd; not all gentlemen, not by a long
sight. I’ve sneaked out and gone to several of their
parties with Eustace. They don’t drink any more than
we do, for they couldn’t, but our boys, rotten as they
are, know how to treat us—have the same code—and
some of those men, let me tell you, do not; when they’re
lit, at all events. And, as you don’t write, or anything
of that sort, they’d assume you were a blasée rich girl
out for larks. You’re a beauty in your own fierce way,
and they’d paw you till you were sick. Neither Eustace
nor Elsie could protect you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up! Shut up!” Gita stamped her foot. Her
black brows were an unbroken line and her eyes shooting
sparks. “Don’t you suppose I know how to take
care of myself? I’ve had enough experience, God knows.
I’m not afraid of sophisticates; they’re probably babies
beside European men, and if they were as bad as you
make them out, which they probably are not, I’d keep
them in their place. I haven’t been to any of your
parties, but I’ve met men at your house and I wouldn’t
put anything past them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, right, my dear. But you’re not their sort—not
yet at all events. Men have to be met half-way,
these days. They won’t bother you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just said those other men were not my sort
either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More so, for they have brains. They’d go crazy over
you because you suggest sex, all right, even if you
haven’t any, and sex is their main preoccupation. You’ll
be safe with us, my dear—and nowhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had played her first strong card and was wise
enough to break off and open her vanity-box, while Gita
strode over to the window and stared moodily at the
calm old oak on the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I needn’t go into that crowd either.” Gita broke the
silence after Polly had powdered her nose and lit another
cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh? Sure? You forget you’ve learned what companionship
means, and I doubt if you could do without
it. Eustace must have taught that hungry mind of yours
a few things. Hasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, according to your own account, I’d not find
any of his sort in your set.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have a plan, if you’ll sit down and look at me.
A real inspiration. Eustace is the only man I happen
to know in that crowd; he’s a second or third cousin
and mother used to visit his mother in Albany. I’ll
take him on as a partner to make our house interesting
to you. He’ll bring as many of his friends to us as
he thinks worthy the honor of meeting you, and will
give parties at his rooms, hand-picked. That way you’ll
have the cream of both worlds and can enjoy yourself
without wondering what will come next. I shan’t object
a bit, myself, for novelty is the only thing to live for;
and as for mother, she adores Eustace and wouldn’t mind
a bit if I married him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you? You intend to marry some day and
I should think he’d be more tolerable than most. He’s
a gentleman, has plenty of money, and an occupation
that would keep him out of your way most of the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in mixed colors if not in mixed races. A
brunette for mine. Not dark enough to be greasy, but
a nice pale brown or olive. A man as blond as I am
would make my skin crawl. Now, if you were to marry
Eustace that would settle our problem nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita deigned no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for a year or two, really. I want you to find out
what it is to be a girl first. But isn’t mine the perfect
plan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds better than it may work out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appeals to you and you can’t deny it. And that
brings us back to the main point. You must have a
companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your voice has lost its emphasis. You know that
you must. There’s an aunt of mother’s, poor but proud,
who’s living on a dog’s income. She’s a perfect lady,
wears caps, and takes nice little mincing steps——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how about Mrs. Brewster?” She tightened the
corners of her lips as Gita dropped into a chair and
stared at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elsie! What an idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine idea. She would do for the rest of the year,
and you’re coming to us in January.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elsie? She’s about the only person I could live
with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so. Think it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—if she’d come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will when I put it up to her. I’ve only met her
twice; once here, and the other night at a dinner Eustace
gave, but she made me wish I knew her better. I’d
like an excuse to call on her and if you say the word I’ll
tackle her today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can’t work anywhere but in her study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way Eustace talks. Sounds to me like
bally rot, as our English friends say, but I suppose your
geniuses know their own business. Anyhow, she could
write at home and spend the rest of her time here. That
mother of hers wouldn’t miss anybody, from all accounts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—if Elsie’ll come I’ll have her; but no one else,
mind you. And you mustn’t call on her in the morning.
She doesn’t let anyone disturb her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll stay to lunch and see to it you don’t change
your mind.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Elsie</span>, after a long and sweeping talk with Polly Pleyden,
accepted the invitation. Both agreed that Eustace
Bylant was the husband for Gita—eventually. And, as
it was out of the question for her to live alone any longer,
Elsie was the one to clear his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I’ll say a word to her,” said the young author,
whose brows still betrayed perplexity. “I told her once
I’d never dare meddle with her sex-stream, and I meant
it. But if she can fall in love with Eustace it would
be an ideal marriage for her. He’s everything she is not,
and yet the differences are not the sort that antagonize,
but complement. And he’s just the <span class='it'>guide</span> she needs—in
every way. An impetuous passionate man would
repel her from the start. I’ve seen them together once
or twice, and I got the impression of a subtle bond
between them, quite aside from books, or master and
pupil, although, so far, of course, Gita regards him merely
as a walking intelligence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let him do the job,” said Polly lightly. “You just
stick round and play long-distance propriety. But if
he says anything to you, tell him to go slow. I want
to see first what Gita’s like when she’s racketing round
with us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I don’t fancy he’ll rush her. Knows
that patience is his long suit. If he loses his head some
moonlight night—well! I’d like to be there to see the
explosion. He’d probably find himself sitting on the roof.
But I fancy he’ll watch out. Must make himself as
indispensable and familiar as the old furniture and Topper.
And then sort of propose without actually proposing.
Get my idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I get it!” Elsie gave a faint sigh of envy.
This radiant assured young person had evidently never
met defeat in her life. But she was the more ready to
assist in the achieving of Miss Pleyden’s latest whim
because on the only two occasions she had seen her
brother since the dinner he had asked abruptly after Gita.
He had frowned as if annoyed with himself, no doubt
recalling his characteristic remark after he had handed
her over to Topper. Probably those black eyes of Gita’s
had been haunting him! She could conceive of no bond
between those two and was determined they should not
meet again if she could prevent it. No doubt Bylant
would succeed in his suit before Gita went to New York
for the winter. If she knew anything of men he was
the sort whose enforced patience would come to an
abrupt end when he had accomplished his purpose, and he
would marry her at once. But she sighed again. She had
had her day-dreams.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved over to the manor next day, and, as her
novel was hanging fire, she determined to make an
experiment. “I know at least one novelist,” she told
Gita, “who writes every new book in a new place. Finds
that surroundings dissociated from habit stimulate the
imagination. So, if you will give me a quiet corner——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, delighted, gave her a room off the library that
had been used as an office by her grandfather, and the
experiment was a success. The social gods were placated,
Elsie wrote from six until noon, while Gita either amused
herself alone, or rode, walked, talked with Eustace
Bylant; who was the most complacent of the trio. He
never deluded himself that he had struck a spark from
his own steady flame, but she depended on him increasingly,
she did not wince, at least, if he touched her
hand, or shoulder, as they bent together over a book,
and he had the field to himself. He knew Polly’s plans
but had no intention of considering them. He still had
four months, for the Pleydens did not move to New York
until January, and he was determined to marry Gita as
soon as he had worn down her defenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were strolling on the Boardwalk one Sunday
morning after what was known as the “summer crowd”—drawn
from every state in the Union—had taken possession
of Atlantic City, and commenting on the lack
of feminine beauty in the American masses after the
mere prettiness of youth had surrendered to an utterly
commonplace maturity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder the girls come here in the hope of picking
up a husband,” said Bylant. “This has always been a
great marriage-mart, even in the days when visitors were
practically all of one class. Now the opportunities are
more casual, but in the big hotels there is dancing every
night, girls are bound to meet men, and the number of engagements
that come off every year in Atlantic City makes
it the goal of all mothers with young daughters, whose
social circle is narrow and mainly composed of women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Gita, who
shrugged indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t your fellow mortals interest you in the least?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the question of marriage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But would you like to think that all these pretty
girls could never find a mate—and fulfil their destiny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always hope women will get everything they want,
and if they are silly enough to want husbands, let ’em
have ’em by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my dear Gita, is it possible you don’t realize
that woman’s one chance of authentic happiness lies in
love and mating?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know they think it does—because they’ve been
fed on traditions and are the slaves of custom. They’d
be a long sight better off by themselves. Love is nothing
but a cherished superstition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, it is not! It’s the deepest and most inalienable
of human instincts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Instinct is nothing but memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly. We’ll call it by another term. Imperative
impulse. And the sex-impulse has its birth in the generative
cells. It has nothing to do with tradition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that well enough. But you were talking of
love. What has that to do with sex cells?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! More than you seem to imagine. Do you
really believe that love between men and women can
exist independently of sex?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Look at me. I love you even more than
I do Elsie or Polly, and you might wear a one-piece
dress for all the difference it would make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Bylant,
pardonably exasperated, almost struck a child in the
face with his stick. “As it happens I don’t wear petticoats——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t either. Bloomers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are impossible!” But he was forced to
laugh. He made his voice gay and challenging. “Suppose
I should fall in love with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see you falling in love with anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen too much of men. They’re divided into
three classes: beasts, fools, and intellectuals. You belong
to the last and have a great gift besides. You’ve got
something better to do than being an abject slave of
the race—for that is what it amounts to—and your
emotions are all in your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that represents your considered observation of
intellectuals! Or are you the average American whose
creed is: ‘Things are what I want them to be, not
what they are’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” said Gita crossly. “I wouldn’t recognize
the beastliness and stupidity of human nature
and of life if I were. But you are as cold-blooded as a
codfish and I shouldn’t like you if you were not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant nearly strangled as he passed over the diagnosis.
“Like? You said just now you loved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love only means preference raised a degree higher.
Stop arguing on such a silly subject, Eustace. What’s
come over you? This is the first time we’ve argued
that I haven’t learned something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve taught you nothing on one subject, that’s
flat. I merely wanted to sound you out on a topic of
somewhat general preoccupation. Your ideas always interest
me and you’ve been singularly illuminating this
morning. Here’s a tearoom. Shall we go in and have a
cup? It’s two hours until luncheon.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> had an old habit of reviewing the day as she
prepared herself for the night. She and Elsie parted at
nine o’clock, for both rose early, and as Gita kicked off
her slippers that evening she recalled her conversation
with Eustace on the Boardwalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been by no means as obtuse as she had appeared,
for love and marriage were subjects never
broached by him before and her keen ear had detected
a personal vibration in his even mellow voice. But he
had talked lightly or brilliantly on strictly impersonal
topics during the rest of the morning, they had lunched
at the Pleydens’, and played tennis all afternoon; she
had not given that conversation another thought until she
was alone in her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seized her military brushes and excoriated her scalp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what on earth was he driving at?” she demanded
of her frowning reflection in the mirror. “Does he want
to marry me? Sounding me out? Well, I hope he’s satisfied.
Eustace! <span class='it'>What</span> a bore.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Or am I to be the
heroine of his next novel? More likely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped the brushes and fell to pondering. After
all, she might have expected it. He was not in love with
her—how could he be, sexless intellect that he so marvelously
was?—but he had spent the best part of every
day with her, taking an indisputable pleasure in her society
(and she knew from Polly that his interest in other
women had been casual); no doubt he would like to
take her on as a permanent companion. She knew that
she had an alert and possibly a brilliant mind, untrained
as it was, and as he possessed his full share of male egoism,
he must derive a tingling satisfaction in molding it.
And it was equally manifest that he was stimulated by
her Giterish points of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was comparatively obscure now, but she was quite
well aware that after she had taken a more prominent
place in her world she would be unable to spend hours
of every day in one man’s company—year after year.
A man to whom she was not even engaged. She would be
“talked about,” “dropped,” even in this lenient age. Or
if society outwardly condoned the friendship it would not
cease from horrible inferences. As Gita’s lively imagination
projected them the blood burned all over her body
and crimsoned her face to her hair. <span class='it'>That</span> would be only
less awful than if some man kidnapped her and subjected
her to every indignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, she would give him up first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what would she do without him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been sincere in her casual assurance that she
loved him. After Millicent’s death she had believed she
never could love anyone again. But she had been made
over in so many ways! She certainly loved Elsie, in a
lesser degree Polly; she could have been fond of her
grandmother if she had lived a few years longer and
been well and companionable. And Eustace. He was
the perfect companion and friend. He never struck a
false note, he was kind, sympathetic, and understanding—unique
among men, she was convinced. He had flashed
the torch of his splendid intelligence into every dark
recess of her being, and chased out the bogies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not bore if he made a valiant attempt, and
he knew when to talk, to listen, and to ask her opinion
on subjects of which even she knew more than himself.
He never assumed the detestable superiority of the male,
and yet was never unmanly. No man could be less so.
He was a virile figure on the links and tennis-court, he
could outwalk herself, he was a fine swimmer. In France
he had served with distinction and she knew that if the
peace of his country were threatened again he would be
the first to enlist. Even when lounging in the deepest
of her chairs or stretched out at full length in the wood
he never suggested weakness or inertia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his books—she had now read them all—had power
in spite of their refinement of phrasing and vocabulary,
their supreme mental distinction. He wrote about sex a
lot, to be sure, but in the detached manner of a medical
student dissecting the physical anatomy. His personal
attitude to his characters no reader could guess. He was
primarily an intellect handsomely provided by Nature
with a sound healthy body that it might send a stream
of pure blood to his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his relations with her he never suggested sex for
a moment. Not even this morning. He had been on the
psychological hunt as usual. She had encountered the
eyes of too many carnalites. Encountered them still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he wanted to marry her in order to keep her for
himself without scandal, that was natural enough. He
had had two perfect comrades in his life, herself and
his mother, and as he had lost one irrevocably it was not
likely he would lose the other if he could help it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor could <span class='it'>she</span> give <span class='it'>him</span> up, not even if she were
obliged to marry him to save herself from being the object
of loathsome suspicions and innuendoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, why not? The ceremony would be a mere concession
to prejudice, and they could go on as they were
forever. She would have his protection and companionship,
and he would have the one woman in his life who
had meant anything to him since Bladina’s death. And
be mightily proud of herself besides. She would cultivate
the Carteret grand manner and be one more feather
in his already decorated cap. He had given her more
than one cause for the profoundest gratitude, and it
would be her delight to repay him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recalled the day when she had sat on the sands
after the tilt with her grandmother and reflected that
she had not an illusion; and a horror and hatred of life.
Well, she still had no illusions but horror and hatred had
fled. And although Polly and Elsie had contributed,
to him belonged the credit of completing the cure. She
was now not happy at intervals but consistently. And
satisfied as she was with the present she looked to the
future with an eager indubious eye. Under his expert
guidance life in all its multiform phases would unroll,
for he devoted only his mornings and but eight months
of the year to work; and it was quite evident he enjoyed
playing his own part in life as well as being one of its
chroniclers. And he had every opportunity to live it
to the full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she, herself, wanted to live, to see all there was to
see, learn all there was to know. A girl alone had small
chance of that unless she had a gift that brought the
world to her feet. If she abandoned her background
she became the natural prey of men. She doubted if
any man would dare make love to Eustace Bylant’s wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled as she thought of Polly, who nonchalantly
assumed that no plan of hers could go wrong. She had
thought her fatuous, fortunately placed as she was; and
here was herself tearing a leaf out of Polly’s book. Well,
why not? Life was fairly shoving her at a book with
pleasant rustling leaves and bidding her choose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She determined to put it squarely to Eustace the next
time he angled. Have it over. Senseless to fence when
the business of life was up for settlement. She’d get
more out of life as a married girl than running round with
Polly’s crowd, incidentally enlivened with harmless
sophisticates. That would be seeing life through the
wrong end of an opera-glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s that.” And she climbed into bed and fell
asleep at once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>But</span> time passed and Bylant betrayed no part of his
purpose again. He had lingered on in Chelsea, and finally
announced he would make no visits that year, nor return
to New York until after Christmas; and while he told
Gita frankly that he was remaining on her account, he
was as matter-of-fact as if he were a tutor reluctant to
leave a promising pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days after Gita had sketched out her platform
Mrs. Pleyden called her on the telephone and invited her
for dinner on the following evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, my dear, it is over four months since your
grandmother’s death, and you must be dull at times,”
she said with crisp sympathy. “I am sure she would
agree with me that you should begin to see more of your
future friends and associates (she means men, thought
Gita), and before you go to New York for the winter.
It will make things so much easier for you. And we are
very informal. The men do not dress for dinner—of
course the girls do!—but when the men are let off that
means we are really informal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, nothing loath, as Eustace would be there to
sustain her, permitted herself to be frankly bored once
a week and made no pretense of listening to anyone
but Bylant; who sat always at the right of his admiring
hostess. His mellow voice came to her across the excited
chatter of the others, who, as she had expected, said
nothing that interested her, even when she understood
what they were talking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant had his more distinguished friends down occasionally
and one night he brought three to the manor
to dinner. Gita dressed herself with even more interest
in her appearance than usual and ordered Topper to
bring up three bottles of vintage champagne from the
cellar, and the cook to excel herself. At last she was to
meet three of the most famous of the sophisticates, her
future companions and friends. But one was fat, one
was bald, and one after his second glass of champagne
fell into a sentimental monologue inspired by his wife
and two children. Nevertheless, their talk at times was
scintillating and provocative, and their manner to herself
irreproachable. One of the men at Polly’s last dinner
had tried to snatch her hand under the table, his
ankle receiving an answering caress from the sharp heel
of her slipper; but these men, either because they were
more interested in her dinner than herself, or because
they looked upon her as Bylant’s private preserve, gave
her no cause for future disquiet. She knew so much
of their world from Eustace and Elsie that she was able
to follow their somewhat random and ejaculatory talk
and interpret their casual allusions. Their criticism
of this author and that was given with sharp finality,
and she rather admired their air of omniscience. She
hoped she would acquire it herself when she was one of
them. And they were rather lovable creatures, for their
blasting comment was without bitterness and it was
pleasant to bask in the atmosphere of people so thoroughly
pleased with themselves. It was apparent they
had a genuine appreciation of Eustace Bylant’s work,
and took a friendly interest in Elsie’s. At Polly’s the
conversation had been mainly of bootleggers. Not that
this subject was one of indifference to the sophisticates;
far from it; but the accident of fortune commanded a
wider range of interests; and perhaps they were not
averse from displaying their resources to this handsome
young hostess who hung on their words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I liked them all,” said Gita enthusiastically to Bylant
on the day following as they sat by the pool in the wood.
“I hope they’ll come often. Next summer I shall have
house-parties. I’ll know more of your friends by that
time and if all are as clever and convenable as these it
will be like having a salon. I should feel very proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your occasional naïveté and humility are enchanting!
But Elsie is going to Europe next summer. You will
have to fall back on Mrs. Pleyden’s aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might be married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married!” Bylant, who had been lounging comfortably,
sat up straight. “<span class='it'>You?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be better in some ways,” said Gita musingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what—<span class='it'>you</span>——” Bylant could hardly articulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’d do very well. What would you answer
if I proposed to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant’s face, which had turned white, suddenly looked
as if the blood would burst through the skin. “I don’t
understand you,” he stuttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean to say you don’t want to marry me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do!” he exploded. “But how did you
find it out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not as dense as you think. I suppose, as
you’re really conventional, you’d have liked to do the
proposing yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it. I don’t care a damn——” And then
a flicker of apprehension in Gita’s eyes, otherwise as
cold and calm as the pool, struck a warning note in his
consciousness. He sank back on his elbow. The blood
ebbed from his face and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us have this out,” he said practically. “Unless,
of course, you are cultivating your sense of humor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I’ve known for some time you intended
to marry me, and when Mrs. Pleyden insisted I meet
those one-ideaed tanked-up friends of Polly’s often
enough to convince me of the utter boredom of a winter
in their society, and always had you on hand to make
them appear like morons by contrast (she doesn’t share
Polly’s enthusiasm for my outrée self, you know), and
when you trotted out three of your friends, infinitely
superior, but by no means dangerous, I knew the siege
was closing in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good lord!” muttered Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t blush. I admire your tactics immensely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you’d see through a stone wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say a gauze curtain with an arc-light behind it. I
fancy I’ll get a lot of fun out of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy you will.” His tones were as dry as his
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’d get a lot more with you than I could by
myself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought marriage to you was anathema.” Bylant
hardly knew what he was saying. What in heaven’s
name was this incalculable girl driving at?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the commonplace sense, of course. But with us
it would be different. We’d just hitch up as a matter
of form, and then we could be together always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no rising inflection in her cool clear voice.
Nor any accent of finality. She assumed, beyond question,
that the arrangement would be as agreeable to him
as to her royal self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Bylant did not raise his eyes; he had
kept them carefully lowered. Then he sat up and lit
a cigarette. His tan did not conceal his pallor but his
eyes were as calm and steady as those hard black diamonds
opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll accept your offer of marriage,” he said
lightly. “You took my breath away or I shouldn’t have
been so ungallant as to hesitate—seemingly. I hope
you didn’t think me that?” His voice was whimsically
anxious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know men are not accustomed to being proposed to
even now, although I wouldn’t put it past some of the
girls. But I knew you’d take forever to summon up
your courage, so why not take the bull by the horns—bad
simile, that. You’re just a dear old ox.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks!” Once more Bylant could hardly articulate,
but the humor of the situation overcame him and he
burst into a roar of laughter. Gita smiled in delighted
response. She had hated to embarrass him, and any man
must feel a bit of a fool who had forced a girl to propose
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he said at length, mopping his brow with
one of the fine cambric handkerchiefs Gita had so often
admired. “I should have asked you to marry me in time.
I was only waiting on a propitious moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re so slow and cautious you’d have kept putting
it off—you’re really a little afraid of me, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am! I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I want to be with you next winter, not Mrs.
Pleyden. I suppose Polly has told you that gorgeous
plan of hers, but it wouldn’t work, not if I know Mrs.
Pleyden. She lets Polly have her own way—<span class='sc'>BUT</span>. Well,
she’d freeze the aliens out somehow, if only because
she’d be afraid Polly—who’s much too good for the crowd
she runs with—would take it into her head to marry
one of them. The sense of class may skip a generation
but it’s a little brass idol perched right in the middle
of Mrs. Pleyden’s inner shrine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose there
are hundreds of decent young chaps about, well-born and
well-bred at that, but if there are they have no use for
the hip-pocket crowd and run with girls of another sort.
Too bad. Polly——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not interested in Polly. I know no one better
able to take care of herself. Are you giving me to understand
that you want to marry me at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the first of January. Things are all right
now, and I’m safe from Mrs. Pleyden until she moves
to New York. You won’t mind living at the manor in
summer, I hope? And coming here off and on in winter?
I really love the manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not at all! It is difficult to imagine you anywhere
else. But I’ll have to see about an apartment in
New York at once. My rooms——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita sprang to her feet and danced on the turf. “And
we’ll furnish it together! I always wanted to buy lovely
things for a house. When mother and I were at our
worst—living in one room in a pension—we used to
amuse ourselves furnishing imaginary apartments. It
was a regular game and helped a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think on the whole we’d better have a house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? An apartment is much less trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—you see—we’d each be more independent. I
could have the top floor to myself—my typewriter makes
a horrible racket——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to have a whole floor to myself, and I’d never
go near yours. Elsie has me well trained. I’d never
dare cross the threshold of her study.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will make a model wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate that word. We’ll just be partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right.” He rose also. “Let’s shake hands on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook his hand heartily. Then she raised herself
on tiptoe and pecked his cheek. “Now, you know I love
you!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t the least doubt of it,” he mumbled. “May I
announce the engagement at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do. Let’s have it over. Elsie will be delighted, and
so will Mrs. Pleyden. Polly won’t, but Polly must find
out sometime that she can’t have every least little thing
her own way.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>“My</span> God!” exclaimed Bylant. He was in Elsie’s
study, whither she had summoned him after his return
to the house; she frequently sought his advice, and a
deep and understanding friendship existed between them.
He knew the situation could not have escaped her, and
had felt that if he did not disburden himself he should become
hysterical and make some fatal mistake. “Was
ever a man in such a damnable situation before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it gives you your great chance,” said Elsie practically.
“She just naturally got herself engaged to you
and she will just as naturally drift into being your
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looks upon me as a male clothes-horse with a
conveniently human head. More likely she’ll get too
well used to me, see me more and more as an intellectual
automaton——My God, how can any woman be so obtuse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember that Gita has had a unique and devastating
experience. She’s erected a sort of rampart about
herself with charged wires on top, and communicates with
a few favored mortals through the peep-holes. To be
more scientific, I never knew a mind that had itself so
thoroughly censored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’m afraid of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is a well-known
fact that when women deliberately repress their natural
impulses, frigidity is the inevitable result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not at Gita’s age. And frigidity is generally
the refuge of unwilling wives. Gita is hardly in their
class! When she should have been enjoying a commonplace
innocent childhood and adolescence she accumulated
a rotten knowledge of depraved men of her own
class; but at least, being Gita, she saved herself from the
worst. Now, after these months in your constant society,
she has learned what a thoroughly decent man is
like. I think it quite possible she is more in love with
you than she knows. She simply can’t make the connection,
that’s all. She’s still inside the fort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course if I didn’t believe that I’d never go in
for this grotesque marriage. The situation is bad enough
as it is, but if I hadn’t that hope—it’ll be hell, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not nearly such hell as if you’d proposed to her and
seen her shudder with disgust if you’d let yourself go.
Now you know just where you stand. She really loves
you in her own queer way, and I don’t believe another
man lives she’d marry. All the cards are in your hands.
You’ll have a thousand chances to make her fall in love
with you, make her feel she needs you more and more.
Did she give you a peck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the word for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve taken a longer stride than you know. It
means a lot with her. She’s pecked me several times
and held my hand once. Polly has never been honored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You encourage me! But——” He stood up and
shook himself, as if in disgust at his moment of panic. “I
have no intention of failing. It’s a matter of destiny,
anyhow. All we realists are romantics fundamentally,
and as she’s the woman I’ve been on the blind hunt for
all my life and I recognized her the moment we met,
there can be only one ending, however disheartening the
prelude. If it were not for her cursed inhibitions she’d
have known it too, long before this. But I can wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Elsie, who had resolutely forgotten her day-dreams,
reassured him warmly. “It’s as inevitable as the fructification
of the soil when the sun shines on it long enough.
We know how we’d work it out in a novel, or rather
how, with two such characters, it would work itself out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A novel that doesn’t belie its name and isn’t merely
a story, must conform strictly to life, and life has many
unexpected cross-currents.” Bylant was gloomy once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough. But there comes a moment in every
novel when the author for the first time is able to foresee
the inevitable end. All signs point one way. That is
where predestination comes in. Now, if you’ve calmed
down, perhaps you’ll give me a bit of advice on a knot
I’ve tied myself into. There are a few things about
the novel I haven’t yet mastered, and one is technique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” Bylant smiled wanly. “Just the let-down I
need before lunch.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> decided to have a Christmas party. She knew
that from the time the manor house had been built, down
through the generations until the Carteret fortunes declined,
there had been a ball and a Christmas tree for
the servants and tenantry, and a gathering of the far-flung
Carteret clan. The tenants were reduced to two
farmers and their families, who, no doubt, would resent
any hint of patronage, the servants to five, within and
without, and the Carterets to one, but at least she could
have a tree and a party. The tree and dancing would
be in the great central hall with her dark-browed ancestors
looking down in approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly Pleyden and Elsie Brewster entered into her
plans with enthusiasm (neither Mrs. Pleyden nor Mr.
Donald was consulted), and Bylant, who was feeling
somewhat exhausted after weeks of house-hunting and
furnishing, and speculating with alternate gloom and hope
on his future, looked forward to the occasion as one
more ordeal to be endured. He should have to submit
to congratulations in company with Gita for the first
time, for she had attended no more dinners in Chelsea;
and he had been able to dodge felicitations himself for
the most part, as his time had been fully occupied in
New York. Gita had gone to the Pleyden apartment
for several days every week (chaperoned by the aunt)
and together they had found a charming old red brick
house with white trimmings in West Twelfth Street. It
had been renovated by its last owner, who had decided
to move uptown, and there was little for Bylant to do
but send his own things to the third story, and “stand
round” while Gita, who rarely asked his advice, chose
rugs and furniture for the two lower floors. Elsie, after
she finished her book, undertook the prosaic commission
of furnishing the kitchen and the servants’ rooms in the
extension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita bought the narrowest brass bedstead she could
find, as a contrast, she gayly told Bylant, to her prevailing
four-posters, and had her room done up in yellow
that it might the more surely reflect the sunlight
that streamed through the large southern windows. The
chairs and curtains were of chintz and the only pieces
of manor furniture were a tulipwood chest, with each of
the drawers painted in different design and soft faded
colors, and a day-bed she found in the attic; both built
in the late seventeenth century. There was no spare
bedroom, and the day-bed, its head manipulated by
chains, was to offer its inhospitable surface to Elsie
whenever she spent a night in New York. Otherwise
it was a chaise longue piled with cushions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sitting-room, adjoining, she furnished almost entirely
from the manor: with a tavern table (reclaimed
from the stables), a pond-lily box with raised carving,
an oak box with two rows of arched flutes, a secretary
with a single-arch molding and ball feet, two paneled
chairs from the dining-room, several Windsor chairs
and two new ones for comfort, a pine-paneled settle
with a high back, and a Dutch marriage-chest from the
house in Albany. The curtains in the manor house
were faded and mended, but many of the fine old rugs
were in good condition and she sent over a pale Aubusson,
ordered curtains of artichoke-green pongee, and had the
walls tinted in harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering her mother’s love of old French furniture,
she haunted auction-rooms and picked up a set
of eight pieces covered with tapestry framed in wood
painted black and decorated with gilt bow-knots; which,
the auctioneer assured his public, had once graced a
château in Brittany. At all events it graced the big
drawing-room in West Twelfth Street, and, mindful of
man’s love of comfort, she had a large davenport and
several easy chairs made that harmonized in color if
not in dubious antiquity. The rug was black velvet, the
walls were pale gray, and hung eventually with odd old
landscapes painted by long-forgotten artists for former
Bylants and Carterets. Singly they were caricatures of
art, but together, and monopolizing the field, they completed
the atmosphere of lightness and charm, and this
room also faced south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant, who was about to re-lease his house in Albany,
reserved the dining-room furniture; his family silver,
long stored, was little inferior to that of Carteret manor,
and included Dutch pieces brought to the settlement from
Holland in the early seventeenth century. The chairs
were Jacobean and a Knickerbocker Kas served as a
sideboard and for the display of the larger pieces of
silver. He also sent for two fine tapestries; and hoped
that his prosperous brothers in art with fashionable socialist
tendencies would not cut him. His own chambers
had been comfortable but severe, and so was his refuge
under the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow hall was painted white and furnished only
with a high wide chair made in Connecticut in the seventeenth
century, from the Flemish pattern, and an English
ecclesiastical chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had been so absorbed in this furnishing of her
city home, and in the fulfillment of an old day-dream,
that she barely remembered she was to occupy the house
with a canonical husband, and Bylant was by no means
blind to her attitude. He was impatient with himself
when he recognized that he was seething with dull masculine
resentment, and heroically made and remade an
effort to adapt himself to his fantastic situation with
philosophy, and trust to time and daily association to
do its inevitable work. To be the sulky misused husband
was no part of his program; but playing the rôle of
sympathetic friend and intellectual partner under that
narrow roof was a discouraging prospect to a highly organized
nervous system, already overstrained by months
of directing a naturally mobile temperament into channels
of unbroken repose—during long hours on duty, at
least—and acting the part of a sexless intelligence. He
foresaw attacks of nervous irritability in the seclusion of
his fortress upstairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, who would not consent to sacrifice the least of
her pines, bought a large tree in Atlantic City and decorated
it with the help of Elsie and Polly. The young
gardener was sent in quest of a cart-load of holly, and
the vast chimneypiece in the hall and the heavy gilt
frames of the Carterets were obliterated. The floor
was waxed and the refectory table moved into one of
the smaller drawing-rooms. There were to be thirty
guests, chosen by Polly and Bylant, but Gita, suddenly
remembering Dr. Pelham, wrote a brief note asking him
to come if he could find time for anything so frivolous
as a Christmas party. Somewhat to her surprise he accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She delegated to Polly and Eustace the task of selecting
a trifle for each of the guests, and the more practical
Elsie undertook to buy substantial presents for the servants;
but the gifts for themselves caused her a good
deal of mental perturbation. She was generous by nature
but hesitated to send any more bills to Mr. Donald.
Bylant had been adamant to her desire to pay half the
expense of furnishing the house, but under the tutelage
of her two other friends, her trousseau had exceeded her
income for the year, and Mr. Donald had formally
“advised” her that he had been forced to sacrifice a
valuable bond. She had replied haughtily that she had
no intention of encroaching on her capital in the future
but that marriage was not expected to wait upon income.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She finally poured out the contents of the jewel-casket
on her bed one night, and pried out a diamond and
emerald from the tiara. She had promised her grandmother
not to sell any of the jewels but her conscience
reminded her that nothing had been said about giving.
A jeweler in Atlantic City set the emerald in a ring for
Elsie and the diamond as a pendant on a thin platinum
chain for Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there still remained the problem of Eustace. She
rummaged the drawers of a court chest in her grandfather’s
dressing-room and found a gold signet-ring with
a lapis-lazuli scarab set in a richly carved hoop with tiny
dragons on its shoulders. It was indisputably an antique
and valuable, and eminently appropriate for a man of
fastidious taste. But some submerged feminine instinct
warned her that he would appreciate even more highly a
supplementary present that betrayed some thought on
her part and a modicum of personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to the most expensive shop on the Boardwalk
and ordered a dozen fine cambric handkerchiefs to
be embroidered with his initials. He might have several
dozen already, but at least he would be made subtly
aware that she had not confined her attentions to his
distinguished top-story. She sent the bill to Mr. Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before Christmas Polly arrived at the
manor early in the morning and announced herself possessed
of an inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not have a fancy-dress party——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no time.” Gita and Elsie protested in chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is if all those cedar chests in the attic
are full of old duds. Modern gowns in this old hall
would look horrid and the men even worse. There must
be stacks if this old manor runs true to form. They
never sold things in those days and of course they were
too good to pass on to the servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three raced one another up to the attic. The
chests were locked, and as even Topper could not produce
the keys, the gardener was sent for to pry them open.
Then the carefully folded garments were shaken out
and inspected. There was nothing more modern than
the fashions of the eighteen-nineties, for by that time,
no doubt, the Carteret ladies had begun to make over
their fine clothes and wear them out. But anything
later than 1830 was rejected with scorn. They sorted
out gowns of taffeta and satin, mousseline-de-soie and
velvet, in styles Pompadour, Empire, Watteau, and the
Four Georges; tiny pointed waists, voluminous skirts,
long trains and mere slips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to powder our hair and wear corsets,”
said Polly, “but we’ll set back a few centuries in that
old hall, so who’ll mind a little discomfort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Powdered bobbed hair will be a scream,” said Gita,
who had been surveying her new possessions with dazzled
eyes and hearing a ghostly patter of tiny feet along her
nerves. “Why not wigs? One of the hair-dressers in
Atlantic City could telephone for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. Leave it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie, who had been investigating a chest, hitherto
overlooked, lifted out a wedding-dress of heavy satin
mellowed to old ivory and covered with priceless point-lace.
“Did you ever see anything so lovely?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know who wore that!” cried Polly. “Your grandmother,
Gita. I’ve seen it in an old album of granny’s,
I remember—granny, who was one of her bridesmaids,
got going about that wedding to mother one day and
wondered why all that lace hadn’t been passed on to your
aunt Evelyn when she married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita laid the gown across her arms and looked at it
reverently. She knew the value of old lace, for her
mother had possessed several fine pieces before they
went to pay a gambling-debt, and part of her education
had been in museums where there was always a room
devoted to thread filigree; particularly beloved of Millicent.
In Bruges and Brussels she had often seen the
nuns at work. But although she had found several pieces
of Irish and Honiton in a chest in her grandmother’s
room, she had hardly glanced at them. Real lace didn’t
match short skirts and bobbed hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this mass of point d’Alençon was quite another
matter, and she experienced the same sensation as when
she had gazed first upon the soft sheen of her pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be married in this,” she announced. “I’d
intended to wear any old thing I happened to have on.
But <span class='it'>this</span>——Oh, yes! And just as it is. The waist
will have to be let out for I couldn’t stand a corset five
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita!” Elsie, who was sitting back on her heels,
suddenly sprang to her feet and clapped her hands.
“It’s my turn to have an inspiration. Why don’t you
marry Eustace on Christmas Eve—spring a surprise at
the end of the party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly, who after months of intimacy with Gita sometimes
felt as young as her years, fairly danced. “Gorgeous!
It will be the night of our lives. I can see you
stepping down those stairs with a powdered footman on
either side——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t any footmen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll hire them—no, make two of the men dress
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t have a wedding like that without your mother
and Mr. Donald.” Gita, surrounded by these ancestral
feminine relics, was feeling every inch a Carteret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be told to arrive with Dr. Lancaster on the
stroke of midnight—no, ten minutes before. Leave it
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But suppose Eustace—he’s the sort that hates to be
rushed—I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hasn’t a thing to do but get the license and wedding-ring.
Of course he won’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned to Elsie, her brows drawn together. “What
do you think? You ought to know him better than
any of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with Polly. Why shouldn’t he be enchanted?”
Her eyes were shining, her cheeks burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you so anxious to marry me off in a hurry?”
asked Gita suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anxious? I’m no more anxious than Polly. I want
to look on at a wonderful picture, that’s all. I intend
to stand on that chair by the fireplace when you come
down the stair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I’m married like that I’ll have to have bridesmaids,
and you’ll both come down behind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bridesmaids——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much,” cried Polly. “We’d spoil the picture.
We’ll be bridesmaids all right, but we’ll wait at the foot
of the stairs. So will Eustace. Might as well turn all
the old regulations upside down while we’re about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita jerked up her shoulders. “Well. Have it your
own way. But—well—I’m not in such a hurry to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hesitation was unaccountable to herself. What
difference did a week make? She glanced at the dress
on her arms. It had covered the slim body of a girl
glowing with love for the man she was about to marry.
Her own wedding would be a caricature of that wedding-day
half a century ago. And again something stirred
along her nerves, ghostly whisperings, no doubt, of the
women who had laughed and loved and danced and coquetted
in these gowns which should have been dust
with themselves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was something both ironic
and sinister in the living persistence of textile and fashion—over
God’s own image! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Those Colonial women
had loved and married as a matter of course, wasted their
time on no problems beyond babies and death and a
new gown for the governor’s ball. Life had been very
simple in those old days in the Colonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scowled and threw the gown on a box. “All right,”
she said sharply. “I’ll speak to Eustace tonight. Now
let’s pick out the gowns for the party, and you, Polly,
cart off the rest for the other girls to choose from. I
think I’ll take this one as it wasn’t made for corsets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held up a narrow gown of gold-colored gauze with
a low pointed neck, high belt, and short slashed puffed
sleeves. Elsie chose a silk robe printed with foliage,
with a Watteau pleat behind extending into a train, wide
elbow-sleeves with deep ruffles of lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly, after rejecting eight or ten of the most elaborate
gowns, professed herself satisfied with one of plum-colored
velvet over a figured satin petticoat and long
pointed waist, panniers and full skirts. Then they carried
the gowns downstairs and put all but two into
Polly’s motor and the gardener was told to take three
chests containing masculine regalia to Eustace Bylant’s
lodgings on the following morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bylant</span> came to dinner and was immediately told of
the projected fancy-dress ball and the riches of the attic;
but it had been agreed that the plans for the wedding
should be communicated by Gita in the privacy of the
library, when Elsie, as ever, had retired to her study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant, who was looking tired and depressed, brightened
visibly. He grasped at the idea of being someone
quite different from himself for a few hours, and his
severely repressed love of the picturesque could have its
way for once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go as one of the old governors,” he said. “Cornbury,
for choice. He fell in love with his wife’s ear—before
marriage, of course—and I’ve permitted even myself
that much. Besides, he was a villain, and I’d enjoy
being that for a night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita laughed merrily. “Dear old Eustace! You
couldn’t be a villain if you tried. But you must be
pompous and stately, for you and Polly are to lead off
in a minuet. We haven’t the least idea what a minuet
is like, but you’ll line up and bow, turn, dance a few
steps forward and retreat. No drinks will be passed
till it’s over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it will be stiff enough. I’ll not tell the men that
or they won’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left the dining-room Gita took his arm and
pressed it affectionately. “I’ve a still greater surprise for
you,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” He dared not detach himself but he averted
his eyes. He had never seen her look so beautiful. She
wore a very soft, very clinging gown, the shade of the
American Beauty rose; one of the fine flowers of her
trousseau. It matched the deep flush of excitement in
her cheeks and her eyes were bigger and brighter and
blacker than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind if we go outside?” he asked. “It’s a
clear night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind, but we’ll have to walk to keep warm,
and you always choose the most comfortable chair in
the library for your cigar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather feel like walking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her long cape was in the entrance-hall and as she
disappeared into its dark folds he gave a sigh of relief
and put on his Burberry and cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what do you think it is?” she demanded as they
strolled down the avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My faculty for guessing has dried up these last
weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found my grandmother’s wedding-gown in the attic
and it is such a dream of beauty that I decided then and
there to be married in it. And then we all decided to
have the wedding the night of the party. Midnight.
Nobody to have a hint of it till I sail down that stair.
Of course, if you like the idea,” she added, suddenly tactful.
“But we all thought the picture would appeal to
that fine artistic taste of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent for a moment, then replied with a
shrug: “Good idea. Something to remember. It will
be rather theatrical, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it dramatic. I mean to get all the drama out
of life I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do? I suppose you don’t mean what most
women would by that, but perhaps you’ll explain just
what you do mean. There’s nothing very dramatic in
being prosaically married and living in West Twelfth
Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can’t plan drama too far ahead. But I’ve
always known I was cut out for it. In a not too pleasant
way I’ve had a lot of it already. I fancy I draw it
like a magnet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m to be the chorus, I suppose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course there’s nothing dramatic about you,
Eustace dear, or I shouldn’t be marrying you, but——Oh,
my goodness! Great heavens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter? Do you see drama approaching
down the perspective of this damp avenue? I vote we
get out of it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something—I never thought of till this
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well? What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you won’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I probably shan’t.” Bylant was in a thoroughly bad
humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must come out with it. My grandmother
wanted me to ask the man I married to take my name.
I wouldn’t promise because I never intended to marry—but,
well—I find I don’t like the idea of giving up my
own name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds like the Lucy Stone League. Continue to call
yourself Gita Carteret, by all means. We’re used to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wouldn’t you be willing to take the name of
Carteret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not!” exploded Bylant. “I may be an ass
but I’m not an emasculated ass. And Bylant, I’d have
you know, is as old and honorable a name as Carteret.
It came over from Holland before a Carteret was ever
heard of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course! I understand,” said Gita hurriedly.
“A few months ago—but I do now. But wouldn’t you
be willing to call yourself Bylant-Carteret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s that. At least I’ve done my duty and
asked you. And you don’t mind if I remain Gita Carteret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t care a hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw you cross before. Do you think we’ll
squabble? It would be rather exciting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in our sort of—alliance. Nor have I any intention
of doing anything so undignified. I’m sorry I
let go, but it hits a man on the raw to be asked to give
up his name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry. Let’s forget it. Suppose we go over to the
Boardwalk and look at the lights. We might take in
a movie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Come along.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> band was in a small gallery, built originally for
musicians, at the left of the stair. As the manor house
was still dependent upon gas the hall was illuminated
by pine torches, safely ensconced in tall vases. The
minuet, which had terminated in a romp, was over, and
the guests were crowded about a punch-bowl which had
been wheeled in on a buffet-wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls had accepted the idea of bygone costumes
with enthusiasm, but the men had required a good deal
of persuasion. Bylant’s friends had protested at what
would look like giving their countenance to a brand of
fiction they despised, and at sacrificing their earnest
modernism for even a night. But after they saw the contents
of the chests at Bylant’s rooms they succumbed:
either out of inherent boyishness or man’s secret love of
plumage. There were four of them: Fellowes Merton,
dramatic critic, Max Durand, columnist, De Witt Turner,
stern realist in fiction, Potts Dawes, high priest of vers
libre. Each was obliged to wear the costume that fitted
him, approximately; and Turner, who was a very tall
heavy man, went out and bought flounces of white cambric
and sewed them to the edges of his court uniform’s
sleeves and knee-breeches. They were all obliged to
invest in long silk stockings, and applied the largest
buckles they could find to their evening pumps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly’s young men sulkily took what was left, and
having less imagination than the others, announced that
they felt like tame monkeys. Bylant sent the fanciest
of the costumes to Mrs. Pelham’s house, and Geoffrey
cursed his friend and vowed he would not wear it. But
he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not appeared in time for the minuet, and
Gita, who was standing apart, saw him as he entered and
for a moment did not recognize him. He wore a long
coat of pale blue satin, richly embroidered, over a
white satin vest reaching to his knees, white silk
stockings, satin shorts and black pumps. There were
deep lace ruffles at the wrists and a jabot hung from his
high stock. His white wig was tied with a blue ribbon,
and altogether he looked as little like a hard-working
surgeon of the twentieth century as possible. She noticed
swiftly that his eyebrows were darker than she
had thought, and that the blue of his eyes was intensified
by the costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident that he had entered into the spirit of
the masquerade, for his habitual expression of nervous
concentration had been replaced by—mingled boyish
wonder and delight in his unexpected good looks? Gita
knew that even as a boy he had been serious and ambitious
and known few of the common impulses of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came forward smiling and shook Gita’s hand, then
remembered his part and would have raised it to his lips,
but she drew it away hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you are my great-great-grandfather or
my great-great-greatest?” she asked gayly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother, perhaps. Your wig looks every bit as
old as mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was rather neat.” She swept him a curtsey,
diligently practised before the psyche mirror; her spine
was limbering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were really your brother I suppose I should have
offered you my congratulations before this. Let us
imagine I was off hunting Indians and only returned in
time for the ball.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eustace is a lucky dog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was staring very hard at Gita, who in her gown
of gold tissue and high-piled white wig above those black
eyes and lashes that he had thought of more than once,
seemed to him almost fantastically lovely. The sort of
girl, he imagined, who, had she lived in a remoter era
than the one she had conjured up tonight, would have
had men besieging her tower and riding to battle with
her ribbon on their lances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Doesn’t he look the real thing? He padded
out his governor’s uniform so that he would look portly
and important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly looks older,” said Pelham, regarding
Bylant critically, “but as determined as Fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” asked Gita sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—the expression’s gone. He’s no longer looking
at you; he’s meditating another glass of punch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have one, yourself. Come with me and
I’ll ladle it out for you. And introduce you to the other
girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you can sit out with me. I don’t dance, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She helped him to the punch and introduced him casually.
Polly’s eyes glittered and she took him firmly by
the arm as the musicians began to play a fox-trot. “Never
mind if you don’t know how,” she said, as he protested,
almost in panic. “Any man who can wear that get-up
like a native—or should I say to the manor born?—can
learn to dance in five minutes. Just take my hand
and a good grip on my back and I’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita looked on with a faint throb of resentment. She
remembered that Pelham’s conversation had interested
her, and had intended to take him into the drawing-room.
To her amazement he fell into step almost at
once, and smiled down with evident appreciation into
the ingenuous orbs of his teacher, who had flung her
train over her arm and was dancing with her usual
abandon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, are you satisfied? Your inspiration is a thundering
success.” It was Eustace who was smiling down
at <span class='it'>her</span>. He looked large and dignified in his governor’s
uniform and white wig, and a massive gold chain was
slung about his neck; but for the first time his narrow
pointed beard did not deflect attention from his rather
plump cheeks and his lower lip had lost its muscular compression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—it looks like it.” But she had drawn her
brows together and looked the reverse of contented.
“You’ve got yourself pretty well into your part. I don’t
know that I like you so well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much punch. My eyes feel rather watery, and
of course we all fortified ourselves with cocktails at my
rooms. I wish you’d let me teach you this dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I won’t. Run along and trot. You must have
asked Joan Ryder, for she’s watching you and is the
only girl not dancing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I did. But I hate to leave you alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expected to be alone. And I’m going into the
drawing-room to rest. My heels are higher than usual
and my feet ache.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made her way past the trotting couples—they had
had no time to learn even polkas and waltzes—and entered
the drawing-room. It was softly lit with wax
candles, and looked, she thought, much as it must have
done when the costumes worn tonight were new. The
paneled walls reflected the blades of yellow light, for
Topper had polished them vigorously, and she had a
fancy that the stately old pieces of furniture had come
to life themselves and wore an air of expectancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She removed her slippers and elevated her feet to a
stool. She was about to light a cigarette, but shrugged
her shoulders. Why spoil the picture? Get out of her
part? She had surrendered to illusion out there in the
hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wondered idly if another Gita Carteret, long forgotten,
had taken possession of her. Then she frowned
and jerked her shoulders. Those old Gitas at her age
had either been married or were in love with a “swain”—someone
as good-looking as Geoffrey Pelham, no
doubt; and, if permitted a moment of retirement, would
have been dreaming of his perfections, indulging in romantic
musings. She wondered if any of the girls would
fall in love with him tonight. Polly had evidently marked
him for her own, but Polly was as cold-blooded as
Eustace; she would flirt with him desperately tonight
and forget his existence on the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind swung uneasily to Eustace. He looked detestable
in that puffed wig and with punch relaxing the
muscles of his face. Like quite another person. It was
all very well to act up to his character as a beefy and
dissipated old governor but she’d warn him at the end
of this dance that if he didn’t let the punch-bowl alone
she’d cut out one part of the program. And she’d never
marry him in that wig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved restlessly in her chair and beat with her
heels on the stool. Once more she felt an overwhelming
reluctance to marry. Of course she had not changed
her mind, and of course the Eustace of five months could
not be obliterated by the caricature of a night. He was
a dear and had inspired in her the deepest affection she
had felt since the death of her mother; had, in a measure,
taken her place. And he could give her the large
free life she craved. But two or three months hence would
be time enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Moreover .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she dimly felt she
was outraging the girls who had left this old manor with
their husbands, before her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who had worn this dress
of gold tissue? she wondered. A young married woman,
probably, with a baby or two!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed harshly, then almost cried out as she heard
Geoffrey Pelham’s voice behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you are laughing at your guests,” he said,
as he took a chair opposite. “The girls look charming,
but the men—well, some of them give pain to a student
of anatomy. I wonder if I may smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do.” Gita had hastily lowered her feet and
tucked them under her long skirts. “You never could
guess what I was laughing at and I’ll never tell you.
How do you like dancing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good exercise, I should think; but dancing with Miss
Pleyden is like dancing with a ball of thistle-down. I
felt as if I should be chasing instead of trying to dance
with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a girl isn’t light she’s not much of a dancer.” The
answer was mechanical. She was watching his long sensitive
fingers roll a cigarette. “You must be a wonderful
surgeon,” she said. “One’s feet are much like one’s
hands, I suppose, and perhaps that is the reason you
learned to dance so quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reddened and grinned. “That’s an idea! Are
all your ideas as original as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita never blushed, but she lowered her eyelashes more
under the frank admiration of his gaze than at the compliment.
“Eustace says I have flashes of intelligence.
I suppose he’s at that punch-bowl again.” And she
frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eustace can carry a good deal, I fancy. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no intention of worrying, but I suppose you
know we are to be married tonight, and I don’t care to
see him held up by two of his friends, equally lit—as, no
doubt, has happened often enough in this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you to be married tonight? Elsie hadn’t told
me.” He was staring at her with an expression that
made her change her position suddenly and the curious
sensation in her nerve-centers gave her the uncomfortable
impression that some other Gita Carteret, who had worn
this gown, perhaps—heaved suddenly in her long sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure she had told you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only had a moment with Elsie tonight. She was
at home when I arrived, to make sure I’d wear this
costume; and as I gave her some trouble I suppose she
forgot everything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Eustace told me he not only intended to ask you
to be his best man but to walk down the stair with
me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t seen Eustace for a month. If he’s written
I’ve missed the letter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be highly honored.” He shook his shoulders
impatiently. “What time is the ceremony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At midnight. Then we go in to supper, and after that
we have the Christmas tree. Then we’ll dance till morning,
when Eustace’s friends will probably carry him
home——Oh! How stupid of me! I should have asked
him to stay here, but we’ve been so rushed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh——Ah——” Pelham found himself stuttering.
“It will be a unique wedding and nothing else would be
appropriate for you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you know?” he burst out
irrepressibly, “I believe I should have fallen in love with
you tonight if you hadn’t already been bespoken—and
by my best friend.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense!” Gita almost shrieked. “I hate that
sort of nonsense! And I should have hated you if you
had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you must be used to it by this time.
Wouldn’t it be more truthful to say it merely bored
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it wouldn’t. Men don’t fall in love with me. I
don’t permit it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eustace seems to have succeeded. Or did you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eustace isn’t the kind that falls in love any more
than I am. We’re wonderful friends, and as we couldn’t
be together constantly without being annoyed in many
ways, we decided to make the stupid concession and
go through the ceremony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I see.” He was staring down at his cigarette,
which threatened to fall to the rug. “But—just suppose
either of you should fall in love with someone else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s tones were heavy with scorn. “Eustace has
never been in love in his life and never could be. As
for myself, whatever I might have been, life made me
into something quite different, and the very word makes
me sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—you’re a pathological case. I see. But pathological
cases may sometimes be cured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when they don’t want to be. I thank heaven
I shall be free all my life, not a slave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love <span class='it'>is</span> a form of slavery, I should think. I’ve always
steered clear of it, myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather thought you were taken with Polly.” Gita
turned in something like panic from any further discussion
of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Pleyden? She is a most charming girl, but I am
frank to say I hardly recall what she looks like, at the
present moment. And I want as little as you do to be
‘taken’ with anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was scowling at Gita, and she scowled back, unreasonably
annoyed at his emphatic utterance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The music has stopped again and I must go out and
row Eustace,” she said haughtily. “Please go ahead.
I’ve my slippers to put on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! That is something I do for myself. Kindly go.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A determined</span> admirer of Miss Ryder cut in early
in the dance and Eustace Bylant slipped out of the hall,
found his overcoat and hat, and a moment later was
driving his roadster furiously toward Atlantic City. Snow
lay on the ground but the stars were brilliant overhead,
and the clear frosty air cooled his hot face. His brain
had not been too befuddled to receive a vibration from
the misgiving in Gita’s, and he had skirted too many
pitfalls during the past months to make a mistake tonight.
He went to a hotel and took a cold shower, then
visited a chemist who mixed him a reliable bromide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt he had his own reasons for annoyance. It
was like Gita to forget that after a man married a
woman he would be expected to remain in her house
unless they left at once on a wedding journey; but
although he had thrown out several hints to that effect her
mind had been too distracted to receive them. Nor had he
been able to have a word with Elsie, who, however, might
have been depended on not to overlook so important a
detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily, his friends would go directly from the manor
to their hotel and leave by an early train for New York,
either to spend Christmas day with their families or to
pay visits elsewhere. As he was, in a way, the host
of the occasion, he had an excuse to linger until the
other guests had left—and then sneak home to his lodgings!
But he’d have an understanding tomorrow. No
one was more anxious to avoid gossip than Gita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a clear complexion and clearer head he presented
himself before the future partner of his days shortly
after a one-step had begun, and Polly once more was
dancing with Dr. Pelham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed Gita. “You look yourself again—except
for that wig. I was going to give you a piece
of my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad I escaped it,” he said, smiling. “I went outside
and cooled off my head. I’ll take off the wig if you
say the word. Only too glad to be rid of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Not yet. The other men would follow suit
and I don’t want my picture spoiled. But mind you
take it off before I come down. Nothing would induce
me to marry you in it. I’d feel as if I were marrying old
Cornbury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you wear yours I’ll feel as if I were marrying
my great-grandmother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita laughed merrily, her equilibrium restored now that
Eustace was himself again. And she felt a sudden inexplicable
desire for his protection. She took his arm
and led him to the deep window-seat behind the Christmas
tree that stood in an angle beside the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was terribly thoughtless of me not to ask you
to bring your things over,” she said. “But I’ll have a
room prepared tomorrow. Unless you’d like to go to
New York at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d far rather stay in the country.” He drew a
deep sigh of relief. Gita had a way of coming to her
senses—tardily, but with a satisfying completeness. It
augured well for the future, and his reward would be
in just proportion to his torments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand tentatively, and to his surprise she
did not draw it away. She smiled at him serenely. “It’s
odd,” she said musingly, “but I don’t mind you touching
me in the least, and I hate even to shake hands with
another man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tightened his grasp. This was the scene and the
hour for love-making, and the seclusion was complete.
“I suppose you wouldn’t kiss me?” Then as she frowned
he added hastily, “Even men kiss one another in Europe,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only on the cheek and always look too silly for
words. But you may kiss me there if you are feeling
sentimental.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The icy shower had steadied his nerves. He implanted
a chaste salute on a cool cheek. “I’m not feeling in
the least sentimental, but somehow it seemed the thing
to do. Old Cornbury, no doubt, kissed every girl he managed
to get into a corner. And knocked her wig off.
By the way, we represent various eras tonight and I’m
not sure they wore wigs in all of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of my party, not history. And they
certainly improve most of the men, as well as the girls.
I never thought anything could improve Polly, but she
looks like the most exquisite miniature ever painted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Geoff evidently thinks so. He’s been dancing
with her all evening. He’s come out of his triple-plated
shell with a vengeance. Never saw such a metamorphosis.
Always took for granted he had the same ugly
mug as the rest of us, and he looks like a stunning old
picture come to life. Polly may have met her fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t that be splendid!” Gita’s voice rang with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly for Geoff. But——” He gave her a sharp
narrowed glance. “Odd that you should countenance
even your friends’ falling in love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but Polly’s bound to marry some day. They
all think they must. And it is something to satisfy the
artistic eye of one’s friends. They harmonize in looks,
in height and in coloring—oh! I forgot—Polly said once
she couldn’t endure being married to a fair man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls have been known to change their minds.”
Bylant’s tones were both dry and hopeful. “Nothing is
safer to bet on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita! Are you there?” Elsie appeared round the
corner of the tree. “It’s half-past eleven. Time for
you to dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita sprang to her feet wildly, her eyes darting about
like those of a forest animal caught in a trap. “Oh, I
can’t! I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met Bylant’s smiling gaze, and her nerves, which
had seemed to arch all over her body and hiss with a
thousand voices, received a sharp admonition from her
brain and subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along!” Her voice was gay again. “And
Eustace, take off your wig.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span>, attended by Polly and Elsie until the last minute
that she be given no time to change her mind, stood
before the psyche mirror and smiled at her reflection.
She had no intention of changing her mind, for she knew
that such an opportunity to outshine all other women
and etch an indelible picture into the minds of all beholders,
was granted to few girls even on their wedding-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mass of delicate lace billowed widely about her
slender figure, and the long veil (exhumed from the
chest later and almost as transparent as tulle) hung from
a high coronet of orange-blossoms “built” by Polly and
dipped in weak coffee. She had removed her wig, and
her hair, wiry and vibrant, and of an intense dusky
blackness, had been drawn forward to soften the uncompromising
stiffness of the head-dress. She wore her rope
of pearls, and, about the base of her throat, a string
of larger pearls, a present from Eustace. They had belonged
to his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes blazed with excitement, and her mouth, which
had begun to take an upward curve at the corners, was
very full and very red. Polly took out her lip-stick
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the loveliest thing on earth, Gita,” announced
Elsie, with the enthusiasm of both artist and friend.
“If ever you are in the mood to hate life just remember
tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night of your life,” agreed Polly. “Don’t make any
mistake about it. Spin out the descent of that stair
as long as you can. Such a chance doesn’t come twice
in a lifetime. Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pelham and John Trowbridge, a friend of Polly’s and
of corresponding height, armed with large silver candelabra,
stood near the head of the stair. (They had
flatly refused to put on livery.) Polly posed Gita between
them and regarded the tableau critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold those candelabra a bit higher,” she commanded.
“And don’t wabble. Nor, what is equally important, spill
grease on that lace. Now, rest your arms until the
band strikes up. I must go ahead and drive them to
this end of the hall. Elsie, better light these candles
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guests were dancing, but the arrival of Mrs. Pelham,
Mr. Donald, and the clergyman in his robes of
office, had advised them of some startling change in the
program, and they were not surprised when the music
stopped abruptly and Polly, her hand admonishing, appeared
on the stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down to this end all of you—over there; and
afterward move into the middle of the room.” A moment
later a mass of white wigs looked like a sudden
descent of snowballs above a variegated flower-bed, ruffled
by a faint but agitating breeze. On the broad landing
Elsie applied a lighted taper to eight long candles set
in high brackets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lancaster took his position solemnly in front of
the chimneypiece that had looked down on so many
Carteret brides. Mrs. Pleyden, who had no intention
of striking too incongruous a note, wore a gown of rose-pink
velvet with panniers made from a point-lace shawl,
and had powdered her hair. She looked haughty and
disapproving, however, and so did Mr. Donald, who was
to give, thankfully, the bride away. Both were astonished
that Polly and Eustace Bylant, the quintessence of modernism,
should lend themselves to anything so theatrical.
Of course, anything might be expected of Gita, and, no
doubt, she had been encouraged by Mrs. Brewster, who
was by way of being a “bohemian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace, wigless and very pale, took his position at
the foot of the stair, the bridesmaids behind him. Topper
and the other servants, who had been put into dominos,
stood in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow opening strains of the Lohengrin wedding-march
stole down from the gallery and there was a faint
rustle from above. The hush became breathless. A
moment later three figures appeared and stood on the
high landing beneath the soft glow of the candles, into
whose aspiring flames they seemed for a moment to
merge as if to soar upward themselves. Pelham and
Trowbridge, holding the candelabra aloft with rigid arms,
looked like graven images. Gita, a white wraith, her
arms hanging at her sides, her eyes fixed on space, but
dazzling with their own light, stepped slowly down the
wide stair, her attendants beside her. All three were
consumed with fear of taking a false step and stumbling
headlong, but preserved their outward composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep sigh rose from the audience, and one or two
of the men whose secret life was ruled by a passionate
devotion to beauty, winked away tears. Even the scornful
muscles of Mrs. Pleyden’s face relaxed, and she reflected
that she would have a tale to tell on many morrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music rose and swelled through the old hall. The
torches seemed to flame higher, and the dark faces of
Carterets stood out as saliently as the living members of
the drama enacting below. The stately trio reached the
foot of the stair and Eustace took Gita’s hand and led
her forward, unmindful of Mr. Donald’s crooked arm and
heightened color. The bridesmaids spread out their
trains and stepped daintily behind. The candelabra were
lowered with a sigh of relief and Pelham advanced to
his position as best man. The ceremony began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Eustace felt Gita’s hand twitch as if she would
snatch it away, but he held it firmly. Dr. Lancaster
had a deep solemn voice and it boomed out much as it
had done at the funeral ceremonies eight months before.
Gita shivered, but she uttered her vows firmly, and held
out a rigid finger for the ring. Then she sank to her
knees on the cushion thoughtfully provided by Topper,
and set her teeth as the solemn blessing rolled over her
head. A moment later she was on her feet again listening
to a loud excited buzz of congratulations. She submitted
to being kissed by Mrs. Pleyden and the girls, then broke
away and ran toward the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are not all famished I am,” she cried in a high
and not unhysterical voice. “And you must lose no time
drinking our health.”</p>

<div><h1>PART II</h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Nothing and Nobody, By Elizabeth Pelham</span>” was
published in the spring, and as critics and columnists pronounced
it another notable contribution to undiluted
Americanism and as her publisher’s enthusiasm expressed
itself in picturesque advertising it had a fair success.
The sale barely reached seven thousand copies, but the
event established her in sophisticate society and the Lucy
Stone League invited her to sit at the Speakers’ Table
at their annual dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But privately I don’t think much of it,” she said to
Gita. “They are all very kind and overlook defects because
it is modern and sincere and rather disagreeable.
But I know I’ll do better and better, and I never was
so happy in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eustace thinks it a remarkable first novel, and I know
it by heart. Seems all right to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie shook her head solemnly. “It has holes in it.
But it is seeing your stuff in print that educates, not
critics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in Gita’s sitting-room in the West Twelfth
Street house, the windows open to the warm breezes of
spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is Eustace’s book getting on?” asked Elsie, who
was still able to interest herself in the work of other
authors. “It should be nearly finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t seen him for two weeks. He has his meals
sent upstairs. Says he always becomes the complete
hermit toward the end. I suppose he doesn’t even shave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was smoking placidly and Elsie looked at her
speculatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your experiment has been a success,” she observed.
“I wondered if it would——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it has been a success. We’ve even had
our little tiffs. Sometimes, particularly at the table, I
feel almost domestic. But when we have an evening at
home he comes downstairs to call and we have one of
our old wonderful talks. The more I see of all these
clever men the more I admire Eustace, for he has a mental
grace that seems to be a sort of left-over and successfully
eluded by the rest of them. I’ve missed him terribly
these last weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad more husbands don’t take a leaf out of his
book! In some ways your marriage is an ideal one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course all women wouldn’t think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More fools they.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita——” Elsie hesitated. She seldom pressed too
close to this still incalculable friend, but no artistic faculty
would continue to function without curiosity. Moreover,
she was still more interested personally in Gita than
in anyone she had ever known, save, possibly, Eustace
Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” Gita, who had returned at two in the morning
from a party at Potts Dawes’s, was sunken deep in her
chair, enjoying the sensation of complete repose. She
had lost some of her color, but her pink negligée shed
a soft glow over her face that would have softened it
as well had it not been for her hair, which, springing
away from her face and very thick at the back, gave
her, Elsie thought, the appearance of an eagle about
to lift its wings and take flight. And her eyes, in spite
of her mild dissipations, never looked heavy, although
less fierce than formerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had ceased to fear men and found many of
Eustace’s friends as likable and amusing as she had anticipated.
Whether a bride was sacrosanct even in a
circle whose bugle-cry was scorn of tradition, or they
cared for no reckoning with Bylant, or thought her too
difficult game for a busy age, was a matter of indifference
to her. They admired her extravagantly, but they
let her alone. Once Peter Whiffle kissed her instep, but
she had turned her eyes away from so much worse that
she was inclined to be lenient and merely brushed him
off as she would a mosquito. They discussed esoteric
literature at odds with the censor for the rest of the
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—once more. You look as if you had something
on your mind. Better get it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help wondering—I witnessed a good many
changes before you married .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but this winter in New
York has changed you still more——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Developed, dear Elsie. You’re careless in the use
of words, for a stylist. We don’t change, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not literally perhaps—unless, to be sure, the endocrines
go wrong. But it looks a good deal like it
sometimes! Perhaps ‘thawed’ would be a better word
still. I shouldn’t be at all surprised to see you dancing
next winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. There are some things I dislike as
much as ever. Men are all very well as long as you
don’t get too close to them. Then they smell of gin.
And—well, I shouldn’t like it, that’s all. Some of those
men are all right but it takes just one cocktail to turn
two or three I could mention into silly beasts. If I
danced with one I couldn’t refuse any of them and then
anything might happen. So far, I’m safe from all but
stuttering compliments on my eyelashes or my ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie laughed. “You’re safe enough. And probably
right. There isn’t one of them, I fancy, who wouldn’t
like to take you away from Eustace, but they’re afraid
of you both.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you <span class='it'>have</span> thawed, and you’ve become
a good deal of a woman of the world; you’ve cast
out a good many inhibitions and prejudices. You’ve got
<span class='it'>used</span> to things. You even took Marian Starr Darsett for
a drive the other day, and it is the particular pride of
our sophisticates that she has had more lovers than any
woman in the world for her age. You find her charming
and you’ve grown as indifferent as the rest of us to
conduct as long as the personality pleases you and jiggledy
morals don’t interfere with table manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all true. I look upon life as a pageant and
am grateful for its variety and not out to reform it.
Miss Darsett is a beauty and a genius and a charming
creature; and her private life—personal rather; nothing
very private about it—is her affair, not mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you see what a stride you’ve taken? Any
hint of sex, even under the ægis of holy matrimony,
utterly disgusted you. If Polly and I had been even the
usual susceptible females, let alone Marian Darsetts,
you’d have swept us out with a broom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True enough. But that was owing to a neurosis, and
you and Polly and Eustace, my grandmother and the life
she made possible, did the sweeping. I am able to adjust
myself, take life as I find it, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s a good deal! I’m wondering if you won’t
go further and fall in love with Eustace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita stared at her. “With Eustace? What an idea!
Why don’t you ask me if I don’t think of spoiling the
very most ideal—and satisfactory—relationship that ever
existed between a man and woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—that’s a matter of opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one opinion under this roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ve changed—developed if you prefer it—less
than I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Odd if I should change in that respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some women, you know, even women that have been
inhibited for one reason or another.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You might
fall in love with someone else. You’ve met a good many
attractive men these last months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None half as attractive as Eustace. He always both
rests and stimulates me and his manners are flawless.
More than can be said for most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you mean to live like this for the rest of
your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Why not? Life is perfect. When I look
back on those long twenty-two years before I landed
in Carteret Manor I can hardly realize my good luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I admit that. And you were doubly fortunate
to have the mental equipment to make the most of it.
But you’re missing something, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not.” Gita set her mouth obstinately. “Don’t
talk that old tosh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it what you like, but no woman escapes it. Even
Polly is more than half in love with my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” Gita opened her eyes. “She’s never said
a word to me about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad sign, as you see her nearly every day. He’s been
there to dine several times and I know they take walks
together in the Park. I fancy the pursuit is on her
side, but when a woman makes up her mind to marry
a man she generally does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny if Polly went back on that old hard-and-fast
program of hers. And I don’t quite see her as the wife
of a struggling young surgeon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I. But love has been known to do queer things
to people. And Polly has the tenacity of the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always said she was far too good for her crowd,
and I’ve seen signs more than once she was sick of it.
But—well, <span class='it'>but</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. She’ll blind herself and perhaps him for a
time, but they’re not suited at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you given him a talking-to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I’m an idiot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t seen him since the night of the Christmas
party. Then he looked like a beau cavalier and was
certainly devoted to Polly.” She almost blushed as she remembered
his explosive declaration to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather thought you’d made an impression on him,”
said Elsie. “And that wouldn’t have done either. I
suppose I don’t want him to marry at all. He’s the sort
of man who is better off alone. Perhaps I’m all wrong.
I’d be a fool if I thought I knew my own brother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
wish you’d ask them to dine and then tell me what you
think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve asked him several times but he always gave some
excuse. When Eustace has finished his book we’re going
to have a celebration and I’ll tell Polly to bring him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—if I were a different person, and you were a
different person, I’d ask you to use your own wiles and
break it up. But as it is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not!” Gita sprang to her feet. “Let’s
go for a walk.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Eustace</span>, unshorn and unshaven, banged out the last
word of his novel, tore the page from the typewriter and
flung it to the floor. Then he hit his machine a blow
with his fist, rattled the case over it, and swinging about
in his chair, scowled at the scattered manuscript. He
gave full rein to his temperament when writing a book
in the seclusion of his chambers and bore little resemblance
to the Eustace Bylant known to his world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had begun his novel in Atlantic City, but interruptions
had been frequent and interests conflicting; he
had confined himself to a rough draft, working only at
night and not vitally interested. But he had plunged
into it as a beneficent refuge the day after he found
himself shut up in this narrow house with Gita; and as
art had been his queen-mistress for so many years, she
showed but a few days of coyness before remounting her
throne. His theme had not only absorbed but exhausted
him. A cold shower and he was ready to meet Gita
at the table or sit with her in that austere living-room
of hers during the evening with nerves that longed only
for rest. They rarely met before dinner, for he rose
at nine and worked until four, and on what he called
his off-days he went to a gymnasium, played golf, or
took a long walk in the country. This last week the
pace had been terrific and he had barely left his rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hardly knew whether he loved his book or hated
it. He always finished a novel with regret, and this
assuredly had been a friend in need! But his nerves were
jumping and his violated ego clamored for utterance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gathered up the sheets resentfully. Why hadn’t
he spun it out? Made it a third longer? Even now he
might pad it, dazzling both critics and public with pyrotechnical
brilliancy. But he shrugged impatiently. He
was an artist and incapable of crime. Perhaps he was
more artist than man. He wished to God he were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a hot bath and cold shower, and not daring
to trust his unsteady hands, slipped out of the house and
went to his barber. An hour later he was sauntering
up Fifth Avenue to one of his clubs, cool, aloof, immaculately
groomed, the frenetic artist submerged in the
man of the world. This club, of which he was a member
almost by inheritance, always called him at the end of
an intellectual orgy. The reaction from the long strain
was apt to be sharp and violent and it was some time
before he cared even to lunch at The Sign of the Indian
Chief, where the sophisticates foregathered and had created
something resembling a salon. A woman novelist
once told him that as soon as she finished a book
she hastily adjusted her feminine wings and flew to the
shops. His reaction was not dissimilar and he moved
automatically toward men who hardly knew him as a
novelist and were quietly amused by the word temperament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At half-past seven he met Gita in the Brittany drawing-room
and gallantly raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel as if I had just risen from the dead,” he said,
smiling, “and had ascended not to earth but to a vision
of paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice to hear your pretty compliments again, dear
Eustace, and nicer still to have you back. But you look
rather fagged—must have been working frightfully hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pegging away like an old cart-horse, but the job’s
finished, thank heaven. A week or two of polishing
and then nothing more arduous than proofs to correct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to help you with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you shall. We’ll be over at the manor then
and I’ll really see something of you once more. Have
we anything on tonight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Music at the Pleydens’. I hope you’re not too tired
to go? I dared not accept for dinner but promised
Mrs. Pleyden I’d bring you later if it were humanly
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sigh of relief was inaudible. He meant to woo
her and win her but he was very tired and a part
of his brain still reverberated to the echoes of his creative
energies. “Nothing would give me more pleasure
than an evening of music except to dine alone with you
and enjoy a good dinner once more. By the time a tray
reaches the third floor things are lukewarm and tasteless.
Shall we go in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long narrow dining-room was at the front of
the house, rather somber, with its tapestries and Jacobean
furniture, but lit with long red candles as slender as reeds.
Topper had been left in charge of the manor and they
were served by a trim maid. Gita, at the head of the
table in a shining yellow gown with a jeweled sunflower
(Bylant’s wedding-gift) at her breast, was a grateful and
refreshing figure after his incarceration, and he felt as he
would toward any beautiful woman who had never stirred
his pulses; although they talked of intimate things. Gita
purred like a contented house-cat restored to the warmth
of the hearthstone, her eyes dwelling affectionately on
the bland and hungry gentleman opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve no idea how I’ve missed you!” she exclaimed
as their eyes met and smiled. “But of course you forgot
my existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—well, I must be rude and confess that I did. But
I am sure you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do. And I never resented it even when
I wanted to talk to you more than anything else in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I once told you that you would make a model wife—and,
I remember, you retorted that you hated the word,
and substituted partner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m used to hearing myself called your wife
and don’t mind a bit. Words only mean what you put
into them, anyhow. To most foreigners, for instance, all
our words mean nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite true. What have you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lunching with Polly at some restaurant in Park Avenue
or with Elsie at The Sign of the Indian Chief, or
with both of them here; going to the opera, matinées,
concerts, parties, dinners, walking, shopping—getting
summer things—enjoying myself every minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit tired of this gay life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather not. But I’ll be glad to get back to the
manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you intend to have house-parties?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think so! Dozens have promised to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you like to be quiet for a while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shook her head. “No, and you wouldn’t, either.
You never look as much at home as at a party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it would be a delightful change to have you
to myself for a bit—say a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Fraid we’d get talked out and bore each other, but
a week between each party would strike a happy medium.
I never intend to give you a chance to tire of me.” And
she gave him a dazzling smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made the proper gallant retort, and asked, “What
time do we show up at the Pleydens’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten-thirty. You’ve just time for a cigar in my ark.
I simply long to see you in your chair again. It’s over
a fortnight since you paid me a call.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> Pleydens lived in a double apartment on Park
Avenue and until lately the large drawing-room had resounded
with jazz at least once a week. During the winter
Mrs. Pleyden gave two musical evenings, a large dinner
once a fortnight, followed by bridge, and numerous
luncheons. She had no intention of retiring to a backwater,
and Polly, to do her justice, never demanded the
ignominy and even asked a few of her friends to the
concerts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tonight, although it was late in the season, a large
company was assembled, and several of the women wore
tiaras—less ponderous than Gita’s heirloom, however—supported
their chins with high diamond collars, and
clung to the elaborate coiffure of the past; but others,
like Mrs. Pleyden—still in her forties despite two married
daughters—covered their ears, indulged in a permanent
wave, or arranged their hair in the manner best
suited to their individual style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden wore a jeweled band above her eyebrows,
and her gown of eucalyptus-green satin embroidered with
silver finished eight inches above the instep and was as
modish as Polly’s. A short string of pearls clasped the
base of her throat, and at the end of a long chain of
platinum and small diamonds she carried a lorgnette.
Her eyes were still clear and bright but growing defective
in vision, and although lorgnettes were no longer
employed to annihilate they were useful for casual print.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her concerts were always events, for she had the fine
taste in music of educated New Yorkers, and a liberal
understanding with stars of the opera and concert stage.
The musicians performed on a raised dais at the end
of the long room, and the guests sat as comfortably as
might be on rows of gilt chairs. The decorations were
yellow chrysanthemums, and a soft golden light was becoming
to complexions both sacred and profane. Mr.
Pleyden was not present. He was the able and industrious
president of a railroad system and spent his evenings in
his library reading detective stories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Pleyden looked less placid than usual as
she stood by the door receiving late guests while a coloratura
warbled. Her eyes wandered to Polly, who sat
in a niche by the chimneypiece with Dr. Pelham. Her
brilliant restless daughter merely blew rings in her
face when, forgetting diplomacy, she remonstrated or
probed lightly; and refused to discuss the subject. Mrs.
Pleyden was not as worldly as the mothers of her own
youth but she drew the line at obscure surgeons whose
parents she had never met. That he was the highly
esteemed associate of Dr. Gaunt, whose mother wore a
tiara in the front row, and whose wife was her intimate
friend, in no way tempered the misfortune that threatened
the house of Pleyden. He might be a famous surgeon
himself twenty years hence but at present he was
a nobody; and although girls sometimes married young
men obliged to toil and economize, and were content
to live in unfashionable neighborhoods, saved from complete
ignominy by one servant, it was always with a husband
of their own class, and their position was still as
assured as that of their friends with spectacular American
incomes. But Mrs. Pleyden had seen enough of Geoffrey
Pelham to comprehend that if Polly married him she
would drop out. It was only too plain that society bored
him, and if her dainty and fastidious daughter accomplished
what looked to be a fell purpose her flat in the
Bronx would be as disconcerting to her old friends as
that dreadful house on States Avenue, Atlantic City.
Her father would be willing to give her a large allowance,
but Pelham was not the man to live on his wife, and
she knew that he contributed to the support of his
mother and sister. The future looked dark and dubious.
She had seen Polly interested before but never serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she noticed that Pelham, whose ear was bent
to Polly’s irreverent whisperings, was looking at Gita Bylant.
Staring at her. His eyes looked bedazzled. She
was convinced that he had not yet asked Polly to marry
him, and although he was obviously attracted by her,
he had never, to Mrs. Pleyden’s experienced eye, given
the impression of a man desperately in love. She had
concluded that the pursuit was Polly’s, but it was a conclusion
that had given her little solace. Polly was born
to have her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment her heart gave a throb of mingled
hope and resentment. Although she disapproved of Gita
more than ever, since that refractory charge preferred
the society of what her own set persisted in calling bohemians,
to the exalted circles into which, true to her
promise, she had launched her, the creature might have
her uses; and if she chose to exert her wiles on Geoffrey
Pelham, so much the better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace was able to take care of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita, after a smile and nod to both Polly and
Dr. Pelham, had devoted herself raptly to the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The musical program lasted but an hour and a half.
As the company moved toward the dining-room Gita
found herself beside Geoffrey Pelham, who had surrendered
Polly to Park Leonard, a new and increasingly
determined admirer. Gita noted under her eyelashes
that he more nearly filled Polly’s old ideal than any of
her numerous court, certainly far more than Geoffrey
Pelham. He was a partner in his father’s eminent law
firm, and in spite of a personal fortune, was ambitious,
active and diligent, going rarely into society and never
to jazz parties. He had met Polly at a dinner to which
he had been enticed by his sister, and his attentions, at
first sporadic, had of late grown assiduous. He had dark
hair and gray eyes, clean features almost sharp, and a
square chin. His devotion to the law in no way interfered
with his grooming, and as he took quiet possession
of Polly it would have been difficult to find a couple so
at one in breeding and so complementary in looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly found him useful as a red rag, and nodded indifferently
to Pelham as she gave Leonard permission
to sit beside her at supper. That Gita’s black eyes had
played havoc in Geoffrey’s unsusceptible heart had never
entered her mind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> had learned the lesson familiar to all American
women, that conversational initiative was one to be
cheerfully assumed, more particularly with men as silent
as Geoffrey Pelham. She began by reproaching him for
his neglect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been working very hard,” he replied, avoiding
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Eustace! He’s devoted to you and has felt hurt.
You might have made an exception in his favor. Do you
really go nowhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t say that. I couldn’t very well, as I’m here
tonight! Dr. Gaunt insists that society is the best relaxation
for a busy man, although I don’t agree with
him, but I do go out now and then. It just happened
I could not accept any of your invitations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! You’ll come to our party a week from Thursday.
Eustace has finished his novel and we’re going to
have a blow-out. Don’t try to think up an excuse. We’ll
expect you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was only trying to say I’d be delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found a table for two in a corner, and although
surrounded by high chatter their tête-à-tête was unlikely
to be interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was still uninitiated in coquetry but her eyes as
she turned them on Pelham were not devoid of challenge,
although she was, at the moment, consumed by
nothing more dangerous than curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear you are devoted to Polly,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed but answered coolly: “Devoted is hardly
the word. I have a great admiration for Miss Pleyden
and she has shown me much hospitality. I—I’ve never
found time to be interested in anyone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly has more in her than you suspect. She is not
only a dear but she really has a mind if she would cultivate
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I more than suspect it. As I told you before I find
her admirable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was delighted when I heard of the friendship. I’ve
always feared she’d marry some duffer and come to her
senses too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say she was less likely to make a mistake
than most girls, and Leonard, for instance, is a fine
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita glanced across the room at Polly, whose flower-like
orbs were lifted sweetly to the compelling gaze of
the distinguished young lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d do very well,” she said musingly. “Polly always
said she’d never marry until she met a man of that
sort.” She shot a glance at Pelham, who was calmly
consuming a plover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure she couldn’t do better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” If Polly were as serious as Elsie suspected
was it not her loyal duty to aid her in what might be
the supreme crisis of her youth? No doubt Pelham was
in love with her without realizing it, so scant was his
experience with women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” Pelham looked up, and in his own eyes there
was something of challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean—well—you see—I hardly know how to say
it, but I believe Polly is really interested in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have amused her because I am a rank outsider,
something entirely different from what she has been accustomed
to.” And he helped himself to chicken salad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was torn between what might be a betrayal of
Polly and the desire to come to her assistance. She
had heard that men sometimes needed but a seed deftly
planted to be flattered into complete surrender. And
Pelham was not the type to feel only the joy of the
hunter. Affection for Polly conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe she is really in love with you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned pale but looked at her steadily. “If I
thought that were true I should refuse to discuss the
subject at all. But it is not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Am I to understand
that you have turned matchmaker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. But I’d like to see Polly happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that you want me to marry her?” His
voice had a harsh directness, quite unlike the mellow
subtle tones of Eustace Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her surprise Gita felt her face flush, and she dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I think I do.” But she frowned, not at him
but herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw but one woman I wanted to marry and
as—that is forever denied me I shall never marry at
all. I’m not the sort of man, I hope, to make love to
the wife of my friend, but—I’d be grateful if you would
take no further interest in my casual friendships with
other women.” He was very white but his voice was
hard and deliberate and his eyes angry. He lifted his
fork and his sensitive fingers were steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned cold and the blood left her face and
seemed to settle about her heart, whose thumping stirred
the sunflower on her breast. She was astounded and
horrified—and not at Geoffrey Pelham! And then she
felt a sensation of sheer terror. What had happened to
her? Of love in the sexual sense she was incapable and
she assuredly felt for this man none of the calm active
affection she so liberally bestowed on Eustace and her
two other friends. She was barely conscious of liking
him, although he had haunted her thoughts occasionally
and had given her an odd sensation the night of the
Christmas party. She had heard a great deal of the
magnetic vibrations between men and women, inspired by
nothing more elevated than the automatic response of the
opposite poles of sex, but she was far removed from
that category. She had lived in an atmosphere of sex
since she came to New York and its vibrations had glanced
off her as harmlessly as lightning from basalt. If she no
longer regarded the subject with profound distaste she
was totally uninterested. Eustace had taught her that
men could be clean and decent and wholly admirable, and
as a rule she chose to see only the fine side of the others
and viewed their moral divagations with indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped her handkerchief on the side farthest from
Pelham and bent down until the blood returned to her
head, then switched on her analytical faculty. She had
been startled—who would not be? Geoffrey Pelham!—and
horrified that she was the innocent cause of desolation
in two hearts capable of the highest happiness.
Polly was doomed to bitter disappointment, and this
honorable and remarkable man would go through life a
dreary bachelor for her sake. (She was unable to visualize
Polly as an old maid.) She felt Jezebelian. And
loyalty flooded her for Eustace. For the moment she was
almost angry at the man whose life she had unwittingly
ruined, and craned her neck until her eyes found her
husband, seated at a distant table, laughing and talking
with every appearance of enjoyment. She caught his eye
and they exchanged a glance of gay understanding which
suffused her with a virtuous glow and enabled her to turn
to Geoffrey, now at work on a peach. She said calmly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was an awkward silence but you frightened me
out of my wits. Will you peel me a peach? It’s a
pleasure to watch you. And when I eat a hothouse peach
in winter I feel as if I had dissolved a pearl in champagne—although
Cleopatra’s wines must have been
stronger than bootleggers’.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was Mrs. Pleyden’s habit to move to Atlantic City in
April and she began her usual preparations on the day
after the party in spite of remonstrances from Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sick to death of Atlantic City and besides I hear
they’re having a rainy spring. I’ve a lot of things on
here and simply can’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was lying on a sofa in her mother’s bedroom and
wore a pale green negligée in delicate harmony with the
pink of her cheeks, unimpaired by a cacophonous winter.
As usual she was smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden, who was packing her jewels for the
safe-deposit vault in her bank, looked up critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would not smoke so much, if only for
the sake of your complexion. The house in Chelsea is
ready and the servants go tomorrow. I am surprised you
made any engagements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I’ll go,” announced Polly. “I can
stay here with father. He told me yesterday he’d be
delighted to have me, and if he can make himself comfortable
with two servants and a caretaker I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden bent over the large box with an anxious
line between her brows. It was seldom she came to an
issue with her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—my dear—you would have a dull time. All the
girls will have left shortly, either for Europe or the country—I
dislike Europe since the war but if you’d like
to go——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even before your friends left you couldn’t have parties.
I don’t mean only in my absence but in that of
the servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sick of parties. I only want to be quiet for a
while. Nothing very quiet about Atlantic City.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid, my dear, you have another reason. You
want to be able to continue to see Dr. Pelham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—what if I do? He’s the only man that interests
me—makes me feel as if I had brains instead of jazz
in my skull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an intellectual man, of course, and if he ever
talks at all, no doubt what he says is illuminating. But
aren’t you rather young for intellectual friendships? Better
enjoy yourself while you <span class='it'>are</span> young and leave those
until later. Besides, how about Park Leonard? I should
think he was quite as clever as Dr. Pelham and a good
deal more versatile. Certainly more your own sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like him well enough but I happen to like Geoffrey
Pelham better. He interests me and Park does not. Those
things are not to be explained. Matter of spark, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it merely because he is rather difficult? You
are used to having men fall in love with you, pursue you
as Leonard does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. What does it matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden abandoned diplomacy. It had come to
what Polly herself would call a show-down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to marry him?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought what it means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Financially? A flat in Harlem or the Bronx or commuting
to some—at present—unknown suburb? Yes,
I’ve thought of it—considerably. But if Nell Croydon
and Hallie Le Kay can stand it I guess I can. Besides,
I always like anything for a change! And in a
few years he’ll have a large income. Dr. Gaunt told
me the other day that his personal practice was increasing
rapidly, and of course he has his associate fees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. If you are able to see yourself living—with
resignation—in an uptown flat or suburban cottage,
changing an incompetent servant at least once a month
and making over your clothes, cut off from everything
to which you have been accustomed, and with a man
who hardly opens his mouth, I have nothing to say. But
are you sure he is in love with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am not, and that is what makes it exciting.
I rather like doing all the work for a change. Waking
him up. And don’t you imagine he never talks. He’s
bored stiff at dinners, and that he comes at all means
a good deal; but when we take walks together he opens
up, and sometimes is almost boyish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah. You are sure you can make him love you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” said Polly serenely. “Just you wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And”—Mrs. Pleyden took another plunge—“has it
never occurred to you that he might love someone else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly sat up straight, dropping her cigarette. “What
on earth put such an idea into your head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please pick up that cigarette before it burns a hole in
the rug. I mean he is in love with Gita Carteret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly rose slowly to her feet, her eyes staring. “Mother!
What are you saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what I am talking about. I saw him looking
at her last night when he was pretending to listen to
you. No man looks at a woman like that unless he loves
her. And I watched them afterward in the dining-room.
He said something that made her turn as white as a
sheet and she didn’t speak for at least five minutes. It
seems he’s not only in love with her but is not above
making love to the wife of his best friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it! You imagined it—every bit of
it! In the first place he wouldn’t do such a thing and
in the second he wouldn’t dare. You don’t know Gita
as I do. She’d have thrown a plate at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is fortunate that her evident complaisance—reciprocation,
shall I say?—averted a scandal. For unless
all signs fail she’s in love with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re crazy. You hate Gita and you don’t like
Geoffrey. You’ve let your imagination run away with
you. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I ever struck you as an imaginative woman?
I doubt if there’s a more practical woman in New York.
And I don’t hate Gita, although I disapprove of her, and
was only too thankful when poor dear Eustace took her
off my hands. A pleasant prospect for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t worry. Neither would do anything dishonorable
even if there were anything in it, and there’s
not. If you didn’t imagine it all you were mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he never talked to you about her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly raked her memory. “Yes—I suppose he has.
It’s quite the thing to discuss Gita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t he talked of her a good deal? May not that
be one secret of your attraction for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not very complimentary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean, my dear, that you couldn’t charm anyone
you thought worth while, whether you let him talk
to you about some other girl or not. I am merely trying
to open your eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll not believe it,” said Polly stubbornly. She
was walking up and down the room, her eyes puzzled
and angry. “But I’ll sound out Gita this very day.
And warn her off the grass if I find she’s been flirting
with him. She’s come out of her ‘fort’ to such an amazing
extent this winter and has got so accustomed to men
raving over her that no doubt she’s as keen as the next
girl to stir a man up——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe that Gita is incapable of falling in
love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. When I first met her I got the impression
she was just the sort to burn herself up over some man,
but I know better now. No one could call her sub-normal,
but she’s what is known as asexual. Shell’s all
right but emotional content gone fluey. Do you know
that she doesn’t live with Eustace? That they had an
understanding to that effect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pleyden blushed slightly. “I inferred as much,
but it cannot last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with anyone but Gita. Perhaps not forever
even with her. Time works wonders even to one’s inside.
But no one but Eustace will turn the trick. He’s
the man for her in every way and she really adores him
in her own queer fashion. She’ll never give ten cents
for Geoffrey Pelham nor anyone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure. She is Gerald Carteret’s daughter,
and the living image of him. Nor were the Carteret
women, although their virtue was proverbial, ever known
as what you call asexual. The men were lawless, and
Gita strikes me as more like them than like the women
of her family. And although she started out in life by
hating men you can see for yourself how she’s changed.
Nothing she did would surprise me. You know how
high-handed she is. What she wants she will have——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more high-handed than I am. You forget this is
the age of high-handedness. What we want we’ll damn
well get. And the devil take the hindmost. Well, I’m
off to dress.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> was only half-dressed when she heard Polly’s
voice downstairs. She had not slept until long after
daylight. To her intense annoyance and perplexity her
mind iterated and reiterated the scene between herself
and Geoffrey Pelham. As a rule she fell asleep the moment
she turned off the light, no matter how exciting
the preceding hours may have been, and she looked upon
Pelham almost with awe that he could disturb the habit
of a lifetime. Even the ugly worries and agitations of
the past had never interfered with sound healthy nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment she was encompassed by darkness she had
been back in the Pleyden dining-room with Geoffrey
Pelham’s voice in her ears, her eyes on his white strained
face until she dropped them in consternation. She supposed
that another woman, recalling a declaration from
a man as attractive as that would have thrilled at the
haunting memory; but her body was quiescent, it was only
her brain that blazed like a bonfire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was not
even sure he had captured her imagination, he had merely
“started something.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt her vanity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But she had had a good
many spasms of vanity this last year. She had been inordinately
set up when she had made a conquest of
Eustace Bylant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her mirror had received a good
many confidences. Yes, she was as vain as a peacock.
No need of a man more or less to keep it awake. Certainly
wouldn’t keep her awake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She recalled the night of the manor ball when she and
Pelham had sat alone in the drawing-room. He had
outshone every man at the party in looks and distinction.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She remembered certain odd sensations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Another Gita Carteret. That was it. No doubt if she had
sat in that room two hundred years ago with a young
man as handsome and winning as that she’d have fallen
in love with him then and there. For the first time she
was conscious of regret that such an exciting experience
was denied her. It would be immeasurably interesting
to love a man like Geoffrey Pelham—especially as he
looked that night. Nothing very romantic about a man
dressed like a waiter and eating chicken salad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, perhaps, was it. Romance. It was not the
dearth of sex-fires she was regretting—that idea was as
abhorrent as ever—but the romances all those beautiful
Carteret girls had experienced before her and handed
down as her birthright. She would even have been glad
if her mother—who would have been happier dead anyhow—could
have gone when she was a child and her
father had sent her to her grandmother. She would have
grown up a true Carteret girl and come into her birthright.
She might or might not have met Geoffrey Pelham
but she would have had her romance sooner or
later.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But no, she had met a good many men now,
some of them charming and congenial enough. It would
have been Geoffrey Pelham and no other. Perhaps they
were both living again after two hundred years’ sleep and
had once met and loved in that old manor. There had
been something oddly <span class='it'>aware</span> that night—but that was
nonsense. She might be too educated to assume that
anything, including reincarnation, was fabulous, but she
didn’t believe it all the same. It was merely the law
of mutual attraction at work. Men and women were
falling in love every day all over the world with no assistance
from metempsychosis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And she was by no
means “in love.” Silly phrase. Moronotic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
might have been and what was were two entirely different
matters. It was merely that some subtle magnetic quality
in his personality suggested romance—every girl’s
birthright—or had that night. There was nothing very
romantic about a surgeon always carving up people and
getting blood all over himself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they had to cut
up corpses before they could do that, and hardly ever
read anything but stiff medical journals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Still he did and that was the end of it. When that
set grimness left his face it looked sensitive and eager,
almost boyish .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and no doubt he could be ardent
enough. He was boxed up—had been—would have to be
now more than ever if he loved her as much as he thought
he did. She gave a sigh of pity. Poor devil. Why had
he lit on her of all girls? Polly was——But she turned
her thoughts away from Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Eustace. If she had grown up at Carteret Manor
she never would have married Eustace; she’d have taken
him on as a brother. He wouldn’t have done for a hero
of romance at all, perfectly delightful as he was in so many
ways. Odd, too. He and Geoffrey were not unlike. Both
were fair, had much the same compact tall figures, both
intellectual and the product of their times. Perhaps they
both belonged to what Polly would call her “type,” and
it was just that subtle difference that made Geoffrey
romantic (in costume) and Eustace prosaic. Costume
certainly didn’t improve <span class='it'>him</span>. He’d looked simply awful
as old Cornbury.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was nice to be married to dear
Eustace. Not for a moment could she regret it. What
use? No romance for her. But it was exciting to imagine
what it would have been like if she had been one of
those other Gita Carterets. She couldn’t even feel sad
over it—too much of a philosopher, no doubt. She felt
more like the heroine of a play—acting someone else’s
lines but feeling the real thing for the moment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder she had been upset at that very real declaration
in that very prosaic dining-room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Horribly
upset. Thought she was going to faint.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Odd, though,
she hadn’t felt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She
yawned prodigiously and fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Polly entered she was standing before the long
mirror of the dressing-table in her yellow bedroom, brushing
her hair back and up. She liked the springing effect
it gave her head, as if she were about to leap upward
and fly, and she was full of vanity and had forgotten
Geoffrey Pelham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Polly darling,” she exclaimed. “You look as
fresh as if you’d gone to bed at nine last night. I’m
disgracefully lazy. I’ll be glad to get back to the manor
and go to bed at a decent hour once more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tired of late hours, myself.” Polly adjusted her
flexible spine to a comfortable chair and lit a cigarette.
She wore a red gown and had painted her lips to match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita smiled sympathetically. “Your mother told me
she’s going to Atlantic City this week, but I hope you
don’t mean to go before the party. You could stay here
and sleep on that day-bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks. I lay down on it once! I’m not going
with mother. Dad always keeps the apartment open and
I’ll stay with him for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! We leave in about ten days and it will be
heavenly to have you here. I suppose you’ll be going
about the same time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may stay here all summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, who had looked like a boy once more in her
silk union suit, slipped a negligée of ivory-white silk
and lace over her head and shook it down. “You made
me get these things,” she grumbled. “I always feel rather
a fool in them. What on earth are you staying in town
all summer for? You’ll pass out with the heat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can always be comfortable in New York in summer
if you stay in the house all day and live in north
rooms. It just occurred to me I’d like a change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a change, all right.” Gita stretched herself
on the despised day-bed and stuffed a cushion under her
head. “Won’t you be bored to death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not while there’s a man in the offing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Park Leonard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Geoffrey Pelham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, prepared, did not change countenance. “Interesting
man, rather, but it seemed to me last night that Mr.
Leonard exactly fitted into that old program of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget what it was. Might have filled the bill once
but Geoffrey Pelham is unique in my experience, and
that suits me better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls’ eyes did not clash but met calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you always get what you want, Polly dear,”
said Gita, and felt an inclination to strangle her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly blew a ring. “Mother said you flirted desperately
with Geoffrey last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I!” Gita’s spine rose as if propelled by a spring.
“I never flirted in my life and you know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told her she was crazy, but she will have it that
you have lost your heart at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita gasped. “Lost my heart? I feel as if I were
turning pea-green. It’s enough to make a dog sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is. You may be sure she didn’t convince me.
If you ever did anything so commonplace we’d all be
horribly disappointed. Now, you’re the one and only
Gita.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But—do you know?—I think you’ve rather
grown to like admiration, and are not above encouraging
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shrugged and settled back to her pillow. “I’m vain
enough. I even put cold cream on my face at night before
I wash it. But I don’t flirt and I don’t encourage them.
Just let them yap to their hearts’ content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do tell me that you think Geoffrey interesting,”
cried Polly, still angling. “I’d be frightfully disappointed
if you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I’d call him interesting. He doesn’t say much,
but he has a quality—magnetism, I suppose. And then
he’s rather unsusceptible and that’s always intriguing.
Glad he’s fallen in love with you if you want him.” Her
conscience suddenly pricked. “By the way, he spoke of
you with the greatest enthusiasm last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” Polly seldom blushed but she did now and
her eyes sparkled. “What did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a lot of things. Different. More admirable than
all other girls rolled into one. Almost warmed up.” Gita
had a very vague remembrance of what Geoffrey had
said about Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he ought to know something about me. We’ve
seen enough of each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you really in love with him?” Gita infused her
tones with warm interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a queer feeling I am. I don’t like it very
much. He’s not at all the sort of man I expected to
marry, and it will be horrid to be poor—although I
bluffed it out to mother just now. But—well—those
things happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t they! But I don’t quite get it. You don’t seem
to fit the picture somehow. Sure you’re not deluding
yourself? Novelty does wonders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think I am. Got a queer feeling I never had
before. Thrills and all that. Turn hot and cold. Lose
my breath. Stay awake nights thinking about it. Dr.
Pelham—at a time when I was still calling him that—told
me that love in our sex was an over-secretion of
hormones in interstitial cells adjacent to the Graafian
follicles; stimulation induced by powerful photographic
image of someone of the opposite sex on the mental
lens, which responds to certain old memories in the subconscious.
Makes me fearfully set up to be anything as
scientific as that, but I fancy I’d feel about the same
anyway. Only hope the sub won’t find it’s mistaken and
go into retreat when I’m living in Harlem and marketing
on Sixth Avenue of a morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you really don’t think it will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t!” Polly suddenly became serious. “Oh,
yes, I really don’t. It would be wonderful to make a
man like that happy. Grow with him. Really amount
to something. I shouldn’t mind being poor for a few
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was appalled (albeit conscious of conflicting emotions
underneath). She knew how little likely was Polly
to realize her potentialities if she depended upon Geoffrey
Pelham. For the moment she hated herself and him.
What blind idiots men were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give herself time to think she went into her “ark”
to get a cigarette. She cared little for smoking but a
cigarette had its uses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If she really had any influence over him couldn’t
she manage to steer him to Polly? He knew that his
love for herself was hopeless and any man who made
the mistake of falling in love with the wrong woman
must come to his senses in time. Men were always falling
in love with the wrong woman, getting over it, married,
became fatuous fathers, and increased complacently in
girth. Love was nothing but a superstition anyway.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Geoffrey was no fool to moon over one woman all his life.
Besides, there was always the rebound if a sufficiently
charming woman who wanted him was on the alert.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She wished she’d had more experience. Pretty delicate.
She’d have to watch her chance; and also watch out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned to the day-bed, and exclaimed with enthusiasm:
“It would be perfectly splendid, Polly. You’d
bring each other out. I’ve always believed that all you
needed was to fall in love with a really fine man and
I was always afraid you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes glowed with affection and Polly responded
with a quick smile, wholly reassured. She’d been a brute
to doubt Gita, and as a matter of fact she hadn’t. Her
mother had stirred her up, thrown a wrench into her
well-oiled mental machinery. That was all. Dear Gita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face fell a little. “I’ll confide to you I don’t think
he cares for me yet. I’m merely educating him up to it.
That is the reason I’m staying on in town. Hope he’ll
realize in time that I’m all in all.” Her tones were
flippant again. “It takes an earthquake to wake some
men up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you break your leg and then he’d not
only set it but call daily and feel so sympathetic he’d
find out right off he loved you? Pity for a beautiful
frail helpless creature, bravely suffering, would turn the
trick with any man not a stone, and you look lovely in
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds almost romantic from you! No. It
wouldn’t work. Mother would call in Dr. Gaunt and not
let Geoffrey through the front door. But time is all I
need and I mean to take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Atlantic City won’t be the same without you. I shall
miss you terribly.” The words were automatic. Her
mind was racing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly rose and snapped her vanity-box. “If I pull it off
sooner than I expect, I’ll leave town in a hurry. I long
for salt water and long rides and a game of tennis. I
suppose Geoffrey takes a vacation like other men and he
could spend it in Atlantic City, to say nothing of weekends.
You’re the best pal in the world and you’ve bucked
me up. Had a séance with mother and was feeling down
and out. When is the party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Week from tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be here with bells on. Don’t come down. You
look tired, and if you find that ancient relic comfortable——Bye-bye.”
And she ran down the stair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>For</span> some time after Polly’s departure Gita lay still,
with her brows drawn together. Her usually clear brain
felt chaotic. A dog in the manger? Nice rôle for her.
She couldn’t have—didn’t want—Geoffrey Pelham. Why
had she alternated sympathy and noble resolutions with
a desire to tear Polly’s eyes out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she was really devoted to Polly—hadn’t even ceased
to love her when she’d felt like flinging the truth in her
face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Vanity? No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Her
brain began to flash once more. Geoffrey Pelham loved
her and that in a way made him hers. Her sense of possession
was outraged. It was as if Polly had made off
with her best seventeenth-century sunflower chest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, not exactly, perhaps. If she hadn’t inherited the
essential endowment of her lady ancestresses she’d found
room somewhere for a few female characteristics. Must
have been lurking even when she thought she’d turned
herself into a boy. She had a moment of poignant regret
for the complete loss of that old manufactured—and protective—self.
Pity they hadn’t let her alone. This mess
wouldn’t have come about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. No intention of fooling herself.
Life had been too pleasant and full of surprises since Elsie
took her in hand. After all, what she had wanted was
drama, and she seemed in a fair way to get it—although
one act was over. But it was something to have been
kept awake by a man and to have inspired a hopeless
passion. Also quite a new sensation to want to strangle
one of her three best friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet. “Damn fools, all of us. And
I’m no better than the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tore off her negligée and hurried into a tweed suit
and thick shoes. Problems always sent her on a long
walk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> she returned she found Eustace smoking in
what she called her ark. He rose with a curtsey as yet
unsubmerged by domesticity and shook hands with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cheeks are as red as pippins,” he said. “Been
having a tramp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to Harlem and back. Polly is going to marry Dr.
Pelham and may have to live there. Thought I’d see
what it looks like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung her hat on the floor, ruffled her hair, and
threw herself into an easy chair. Eustace was staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly and Geoff——I don’t grasp it. You must be
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t breathe it. But legally we are one, and
there’s no harm in telling you. I think it’s serious with
both.” She had no intention of betraying Polly further,
but the desire to talk of the momentous possibility was
irresistible and Eustace was safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Legally we are one.’ ” He repeated the words automatically;
then recovered himself and drew on his pipe.
“I never heard of a more brilliant example of mismating.
Last about a year, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know Polly. She can be anything she likes.
And love does wonders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” He almost dropped his pipe. “That’s an odd
statement to come from you. What do you know about
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mind works. And I’ve seen a good deal of life,
first and last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly. But the word ‘love’ sounds queer on your
lips. And I don’t believe it’s anything but a word to you.
I doubt if you have any conception of the meaning of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her intently. Most of her old inhibitions
and prejudices had dissolved. She was more adaptable,
more tolerant, more responsive, more what she might have
been had destiny been kinder. But how deeply had the
new life changed her? She was remarkably like the old
Gita still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a brilliant smile. “Some
stylists say you should never use a long word when a
short one will serve, nor a derivative if you can find a
Saxon. Don’t agree with them, as I’ve always thought
Swinburne’s ‘Chastelard’ as cold and dry as a bone. But
hack words are convenient, that’s all, though one may be
bored to death with them. I wonder the word ‘love’ has
any meaning left in it. You’re so clever, I should think
you’d invent a new vocabulary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I write to be read.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I remember you once said
that love was merely preference raised to a higher degree
than like. But as your experience has grown perhaps
you are willing to admit there are different degrees in the
temperature of love itself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like it.” Gita drew her black brows together.
“I merely accept the fact because I have to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant had laid down his pipe and was twisting his
short pointed beard. He eyed her speculatively, but not
coldly. She looked warm and rosy and alluring in the
deep chair, with her tumbled hair and bright eyes, and
he would have given his new novel to kiss her; he half
believed the time of his probation was shrinking. He
had intended to wait for the woods and summer, but there
was no harm in putting out an antenna or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you ever feel you’re missing something?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I? What? Oh, you mean because I can’t make a
fool of myself like other women. No, I don’t.” But she
blushed unaccountably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace interpreted the blush as an uneasy response to
a fact long ignored. “Gita!” he exclaimed, suddenly illuminated
by a brilliant idea. “Let’s play a game. We
can’t discuss intellectual subjects forever. We’d dry up.
It’s time to strike a lighter note. Suppose we pretend we
are not married and I’ve come wooing. And you are rather
interested, but uncertain; willing to lead me on; curious
to see if I could make an impression on your hard little
heart. Pretty certain you’ll throw me over, but curious
enough to give me a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita stared at him with mouth open. “What a perfectly
ridiculous idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. Scientific matrimony. A science more
married people would do well to study, and the keynote
is variety. Besides, I’ve been working so long I feel in
the mood for play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita dug the toe of her boot into the rug. “I don’t
think I could play up. You see, I know I couldn’t fall in
love with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant turned cold, but he answered steadily: “It would
be a part of your end of the game to make yourself think
you might. You have imagination, if you would consent
to use it. You’re not nearly so matter-of-fact as you like
to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no actress, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every woman is an actress. As safe to bet on as that
no woman knows the sort of man she’ll fall in love with.
Look at Polly. Love, for that matter, is often due to the
planting of a suggestion on one side or the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly says Dr. Pelham told her that love is——Oh,
lord! Can I remember all that? Matter of over-secretion
of hormones in cells next door to some kind of
follicles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace burst into a roar of laughter. “Sounds like
old Geoff. Is that the sort of diet he feeds Polly on?
She must be in love with him if she can stand it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Polly’s up on endocrines. Every once in a while she
and Elsie get going on the subject, but I always shut
them up. Never did like the idea of knowing too much
about my inwards. Don’t know which side my liver is
on and always dodged physiology at school. Suppose it’s
because I never was ill in my life. Besides, as far as I
can make out, they wouldn’t take much interest in endocrines
if one set didn’t happen to be stocked up with
sex and made the others dance to its tune more or less.
That’s enough for me. By the way, what do you think
Elsie told me the other day—said she thought the time
had come when I could stand it——” She paused
abruptly and jerked her shoulders, her brows an unbroken
and twisted line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d be interested to know.” His eyes narrowed to
conceal a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to repeat it and she made me so furious I could
have thrown something at her. Said the reason I never
could look like a boy was because I had no male cells in
some place or other—that if I had, with the morbid
psychology induced by my early experience and hatred
of your sex, nothing could have ‘saved’ me. I wonder
if people were always sex-mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably. Today they are more verbally interested
because for the first time they know something of cause
instead of merely taking effect for granted, and romanticizing
it. But Elsie was quite right. You have an uncommonly
balanced endocrine constitution and you may
be thankful——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prefer not to think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t. Forget it by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall, now that I’ve unloaded it on you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should
think that knowing too much would be the death of
romance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite. And far better for the race. But you’re the
last person I should expect to set up a wail over the death
of romance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. Jolly good thing it’s out of date. Merely made
an observation. You’ve taught me to look all round a
subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re the aptest of pupils. But I’m tired of
playing schoolmaster—for the present—and I should
think that in time it would corrode the vanity of a beautiful
and highly intelligent woman to sit constantly at the
feet of a man. Do let us play for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita looked hard at him, but he returned her stare unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said yourself that love was a matter of suggestion,
and you might come to fancy you were really
in love with me,” she remarked. “That would be simply
horrid and spoil everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My imagination never runs away with me even when
I am writing fiction. And I assure you I shall never be in
doubt of my true sentiments for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita smiled. “You do play rather well. I’ve often
watched you at parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whole-heartedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked prosaic enough with that beard and those
rather plump cheeks. And if she could simulate interest
in him it would help her to be noble with Polly. If
Geoffrey Pelham looked on, so much the better. Another
act in her play—more unreal than the stage itself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.” She caught her hat by the crown and
stood up. “What’s the first move? How do I do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me. Just be the flying princess for a
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She grinned widely. “Good title for a musical comedy.
And I’ll like that rôle well enough.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Eight</span> or ten of the guests were up in Bylant’s rooms
playing poker and refreshing themselves at will. Extravagantly
as they admired Gita they were a little in
awe of her in her own house, and when under her eye
assuaged their thirst discreetly. Bylant had a wide bed
and a divan, if they were forced to remain for the night,
and he could sneak them downstairs in the morning before
his wife was awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had given several parties during the winter but
refused to ask more than forty at a time. She disliked
crowded rooms, where the selfish appropriated the chairs
and sofas permanently, while the others were forced to
stand about or wander. A few always retired to her ark,
those who liked to hear themselves talk and two or three
who had formed the habit of listening. A mutually interested
couple generally migrated to the ecclesiastical
chest in the hall. In the large drawing-room and connecting
dining-room the rest of the guests sat comfortably,
drank the cocktails and whisky and soda passed by the
host and gave a divided attention to the spontaneous performances
of the livelier members of the company. There
was a good deal of music tonight, a diseuse was convulsing
and brief, there were impromptu little plays and much
staccato talk. One distinguished exponent of bald realism
untempered by art, too swiftly susceptible to synthetic
gin, stole upstairs early in the evening and appropriated
the divan for the night. A dark young actress, famous
as a stage adventuress, who barely tolerated any man but
her husband and drank nothing stronger than root-beer,
curled up in an easy chair and went to sleep; her invariable
habit. Polly had steered Dr. Pelham into a
corner behind the piano and kept him there, and Elsie,
who was helping Gita play hostess, watched her brother
out of a corner of her eye. Many celebrities were present:
Gora Dwight, a novelist both popular and important;
Lee Clavering, whose play had been a Broadway sensation
since September; Marian Starr Darsett; De Witt Turner
and his wife, Suzan Forbes; Potts Dawes; Max Durand;
Fellowes Merton; Helen Vane Baker, of two worlds, and
Peter Whiffle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While a young musical-comedy actress was giving the
convolutions of a skirt-dance, spontaneously invented,
Gita found an empty chair behind a door and indulged in
a yawn. She suddenly felt bored with New York and
parties. And clever people could be as monotonous in
time as the more stereotyped society to which Mrs. Pleyden
had introduced her. What did it all amount to? They
went on like this winter after winter and not one of them
looked blasé, not even Marian Starr Darsett, who was
reputed to be entering upon her hundred-and-ninth love-affair.
But they all had some gift, or used their brains
otherwise to a definite purpose. Hers was like a whirlpool,
careering round and round in circles and to no purpose
whatever. The simile stopped at the vortex; she
never got as far as that!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next winter? And next? And next? The prospect
was appalling.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However, after six months in the
country—reactions were automatic.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She had arranged
for several house-parties—and felt disposed to
withdraw the invitations. But that would leave her alone
with Eustace. He bored her less than anyone, but if he
kept up that ridiculous game she’d explode before they’d
been isolated in the manor a week. His “wooing,” tentative
so far as became the first stage, had shown him to be
possessed of more charm than she had suspected, but
she preferred him without it. How could they ever get
back to their old relationship when the game was given
up as a bad job? She hated make-believe anyway. She
was made for realities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Realities? What were they?
In this sort of life, anyhow? Perhaps, after all, she’d
have been better satisfied with life if she had been forced
to take a job in San Francisco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although she had had spasms of restlessness and dissatisfaction
of late, not to mention certain abrupt flights
of imagination, she had felt nothing of the sort when she
had stood before her mirror a few hours earlier and put
the finishing touches to her toilette. Her gown was white
and silver and vastly becoming. She wore all her pearls,
and had applied a light touch of powder. But as she sat
there behind the door, almost concealed from her guests,
she lost all interest in her beauty. Polly was far prettier
than she and always looked her most dazzling in red. Tonight
she wore a quaint flaming head-dress and little gold
curls escaped everywhere. She hadn’t left Pelham’s side
for a moment since they entered at nine o’clock, and it
was now a quarter to twelve. And he looked anything
but bored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you hiding, Miss Carteret?” De Witt Turner
was looming over her, his great bulk encased in loose
tweed. If he possessed evening clothes he never wore
them. “Your party is a stunning success as usual. I
hope we haven’t tired you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it. Do sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only unoccupied chair was one of the small upright
contributions from Brittany, and Turner disposed
himself carefully; then finding it more secure than most
ancient furniture, hunched down and lit a cigarette. “Do
you know what I’ve been wondering?” he continued. “If
by any chance you brought over those ancestral costumes
of yours? We might all dress up again and improvise a
sort of Colonial farce. I rather yearn for my flounces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita smiled up at him without effort; he was one of
her favorites. “Too bad. They’re down at the manor.”
And then she surprised herself by announcing: “I’ve
locked them in their chests for good and all. They’ll
never be worn again in my time. You see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it would
be a pity to cheapen the first impression. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Artistically you’re right, no doubt. But it seems
rather a pity—sort of waste. Perhaps that’s rather hypocritical
of me. We all enjoyed looking like bloods for
once, to say nothing of imagining ourselves handsome.
The men, I mean. I think I prefer women in their modern
frocks and short hair. But Dr. Pelham, for instance, will
never look like that again unless you relent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Gita’s annoyance she felt herself blushing, a new
and ridiculous habit of hers. There had been a time when
she prided herself upon a fine static red and laughed at
girls whose color changed with every passing emotion.
“I’m sure he doesn’t want to,” she replied tartly. “Surgeons
are scientists, you know, and scientists have no use
for anything so frivolous as fancy dress. About the most
matter-of-fact men in the world, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um. Science requires imagination of a certain sort
and surgery is nervous work. The most temperamental
man I know is a surgeon.” His glance traveled to the
corner behind the piano. “Scientists have even been
known to fall in love. I should say Pelham had some
use for Miss Pleyden. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Polly lovely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is, indeed. No wonder he’s bowled over.” But
like Mrs. Pleyden, he had seen certain straying glances
from Pelham’s unambiguous eyes. He had also noted
the blush. Gita was a puzzle to him and he sometimes
suspected she was still a puzzle to his friend, known as
her husband. As a novelist he would have liked to solve
it. His fiction, although it dealt with the prosaic realities
of life, and he handled sex without tongs, was pervaded
by a haunting almost poignant beauty, which drove from
his inner being not from his theme. He was in no danger
of falling in love with Gita, being quite satisfied with
“Miss Forbes,” and, like musicians, preferring to find
beauty on the abstract plane; but he never saw this particular
beauty with her lofty “springing” little head, her
black flashing eyes that seemed to carry back no farther
than her mind, her curious aura of virginity, her contradictory
magnetic personality and undeviating aloofness,
and a certain checked sweetness with it all, without the
sensation that some musical instrument within him was
vibrating to new harmonies, and he longed to grasp and
immortalize them. In other words he would have liked
to make her the heroine of a novel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the music was too elusive. He only faintly guessed
what she suggested. She looked one thing and was so
indisputably something else. Once he had tried to pump
Elizabeth Pelham, but that loyal friend had laughed at his
assumption of mystery. Gita was just Gita. One answer
to the riddle, no doubt, was that the girl didn’t know herself.
Something had arrested her development, and the
man she had married that night when she came down the
stairs and made himself nearly bawl outright with her
astounding beauty, had as yet taught her nothing. He
had met her several times before the wedding and many
times since, and although she no longer treated every man
as a possible enemy, she had changed not at all in essentials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But was she on the verge of a change of some sort?
He noted that she looked tired and rather melancholy
for the first time since he had known her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. less assured.
An ardent feminist, he believed in women taking
precisely the same liberties with orthodoxies as men had
done since the beginning of time; and if this entrancing
creature had found she was mistaken and contemplated
throwing over poor old Eustace, why not? Men were
pretty philosophical these days—taking a leaf out of the
age-old Book of Woman—and although it would come
hard on Bylant, no doubt, if he found she preferred another
man, he’d renounce her without whimpering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would she? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did she? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or, why not?
He felt there was a key to the riddle somewhere and
wished he knew her history. But he knew nothing beyond
the bare facts that she had been born and brought up in
Europe, had lived for a time in California, and arrived in
New Jersey shortly before her grandmother’s death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you thinking of?” asked Gita, smiling.
“You haven’t said a word for five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You. I was wondering how long we’d have you with
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an idea. You’ll probably sit with me in this
room at precisely the same hour next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The slight bitterness of your accent confirms my misgivings.
I doubt if you’ll be in this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” she asked, frowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that you’ve been fumbling, so far—not even
experimenting, like most women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like either word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither really should apply to you. You’re extremely
clear-sighted about most things, but there’s a catch somewhere.
I can’t get it. I’d like to, and I too am fumbling,
just now. At all events that is the way you impress me,
and I’ve a hazy idea that you’ll come out of the fog
before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out of the fog?” Gita stared at him under
lowered brows and then jerked her head. “I forgot you
were a maker of phrases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only when I’m sweating at the typewriter. I assure
you that was spontaneous—and seems to fit you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Out of the fog.’ ” Her voice sounded dazed. “Do
you mean I don’t know where I am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that. You’re a riddle to yourself, as
you are to other people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not true! I know myself perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you dwell in another dimension from the rest
of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita colored angrily. “By that, I suppose, you mean I
am even more conceited than the rest of you. Quite a
feat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed good-naturedly. “Quite, indeed. And
you’re not. But you’re very honest. Do you really believe
you’ve explored yourself thoroughly—made a complete
chart of all the subterranean streams, and peaks—sort
of magnet for fogs? Now, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita moved uneasily. “Yes, I do. I’ve had a very
wide and varied experience of life that you know nothing
about. No one has ever had an opportunity to gauge
herself more exhaustively than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I’m not surprised to hear you say that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You suggest a play in four acts with a prologue and
epilogue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I can’t make even a guess. Have
you ever been in love?” he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita drew herself up haughtily. “That question was
in excessively bad taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve abandoned taste with other old clichés.” But
he took the edge from this announcement of an unassailable
fact with a disarming smile. “And if you haven’t,
you will, you know. You’re not in the least in love with
Eustace, and you’ve got it coming—when the fog lifts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was angling, and had hoped for a minnow, but was
by no means prepared for a whale. Gita turned white,
then almost purple; her eyes shot red sparks and her
mouth drew back until it made an ugly grimace. For a
moment he thought she was going to strike him. A
curious devastating force seemed to emanate from her and
he turned hot all over, as if his skin had been seared.
He was almost terrified but had the presence of mind to
move forward; if his face were slapped his ignominy
would not be too public at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expression lasted but an instant and her face settled
into a mask of fear; he had the impression that she
was no longer aware of his presence. “If I thought that,”
she articulated, “I’d go out and kill myself. It is the
most hideous fate that can befall a woman, the most
loathsome and degrading. But—thank God!—I’m not
capable of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another lightning change and he was staring,
almost open-mouthed, at the Miss Carteret to whom he
was so agreeably accustomed. “You psychological novelists,”
she said complainingly, “with your everlasting probing,
get on my nerves. And your assumption that you
can make a fashion of bad taste even more. The radical
is not in the saddle yet, and even when he is, there will be
groups in which manners and codes will survive and become
the standard once more when the same old wheel
has finished the same old revolution. Look at France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled amusedly. “Perhaps. But freedom of
speech and of thought seems to me of more consequence
than taste.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I wouldn’t offend you for the
world,” he added hastily. “Nor, for a jugful, have you
other than you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks.” She rose, and smiled as he rose also.
“Odd, you never forget your own manners. What a lot
of self-posers we are! I see that supper is being brought
in and I’m sure you want yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” Turner almost whistled as he stood where
she had left him. “Whew!” And he wondered if he had
had a glimmer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I’m</span> going down to the manor tomorrow,” announced
Gita as she and Eustace lingered for a moment in the
drawing-room after the last guest had departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tomorrow? But we were not to go until Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t go. In fact I’d like to be alone for a
while. Tired out. Don’t want to open my mouth for a
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! As you please, of course. I’ll be detained until
Tuesday. You do look tired,” he added solicitously.
“But I shall miss you abominably. Couldn’t you shut
yourself up here and rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want my old manor more than anything in the
world!” she said passionately. “And I must be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stifled both astonishment and curiosity. “Then you
shall have it, or anything else you want. Sit down for
a moment and have a cigarette.” And Gita, who had no
desire for the solitude of her bed, obeyed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have to sleep on that davenport,” he said
humorously. “Three of my friends are dead to the world
upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Fraid it’s bootlegger gin.” And then he slipped on
the harness of his new rôle. “I saw you hidden in a corner
with De Witt Turner for at least a quarter of an
hour,” he said with a nice assumption of jealousy.
“Women fall for him very hard, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they? They must be fools. I hate him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant raised his brows in genuine surprise. “Hate
old Witt? He’s about the least hatable man in New
York, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t endure him and I’m not going to ask
him to one of the house-parties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he make love to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think not. He wouldn’t dare. He merely
says anything that comes into his head, and he’s a boor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, not that. He’s a gentleman, with deliberately
applied excrescences. He dresses like a farmer to reconcile
his income with his moral approval of socialism, and if
he berates old codes and standards to which he was born,
that is but one phase of this attempt to coördinate a new
and militant fact with the ancient instinct of self-preservation.
The new man is having as hard a time of it as the
new woman had a quarter of a century ago—trying to be
something he isn’t. At least men of Witt’s breeding.
They’ve got to shake down, that’s all. You’re too clear-visioned
to take this particular phase of social evolution
for anything but what it’s worth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps,” hopefully,
“he merely bored you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, probably.” But she knew it was not. She
hated Turner because he had for some inexplicable reason
infuriated her with the mere use of a word of four letters
which for months she had bandied about with the rest.
She had behaved exactly as she would have done a year
ago, while she was still inside her “fort,” as Elsie had so
aptly expressed it. No doubt that ridiculous suggestion
of drifting in a fog had a good deal to do with it. But
she knew she had betrayed something, she hardly knew
what, to the enterprising eye of that novelist, and she
wished never to see him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us forget him,” said Eustace softly. “May I tell
you that I never saw you look as lovely as you do tonight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your compliments sound exactly the same as they did
before you set about trying to be something <span class='it'>you’re</span> not!”
Gita, glad of the diversion, laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you promised to play up! Let us imagine we are
guests who have lingered down here for a few last words
while our hosts have gone decorously to bed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Instead of three drunks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not worth remembering. I have persuaded
you to linger on for a little talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here I am.” Gita stifled a yawn. “Rather
sleepy, but I’ll do my best. Anyhow, I never like you so
much as when I’ve been with a lot of tiresome people.”
And she hoped her smile was bewitching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own was spontaneous. “Don’t you think you could
like me a little?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like you a lot——Oh, no, I mean—what the devil
do girls say? I suppose I ought to know as I’ve read that
question five hundred times in novels. Wish I could remember
the answers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say what you think you would say if you really were
a girl rather interested and I were trying to make you
more so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita raked her mind. This little comedy with Eustace
often amused her. “I—think—I’m rather beginning to,”
she faltered, and batted her eyelashes as she had seen Eva
Le Gallienne do on the stage a few nights since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eustace drew up his chair and bent over her. He had
begun to turn off the lights before they fell into conversation
and in the soft dimness he looked rather handsome
to Gita’s critical eye. Distinguished he always looked.
Perhaps she had been wrong—hadn’t known her personal
predilections so well, after all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it were in her to
“love” any man it should be this one, who combined so
much, and whom, her sharp eyes had long since informed
her, other women found so attractive. She smiled indulgently
and repressed a desire to say: “Go ahead.” She
would play up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant himself was a little at a loss. He had never set
out deliberately to “woo” a woman, and although he had
more than once fallen into step without visible effort, he
had, on the whole, accepted casually and briefly what was
offered him. He felt resentfully that he would know how
to handle the situation in a novel, and wondered why
pen-experience should avail him so little when it came to
his own vital concerns. Possibly because he was so confoundedly
in earnest, and detachment annihilated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beginning?” He laid his hand on hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita patted it amiably. “Nice hands. Strong, but
well-shaped. Not too artistic to be manly. And always
warm, and not too soft—or white. That’s your golf and
tennis——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Gita!” he said despairingly. “Lovers—would-be
lovers—don’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You should either draw your hand
away shyly or turn it over and give mine a slight pressure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Let’s begin over. I think I’ll do the last.
You often make me feel you’re here to hang on to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not worried about anything?” In the dim light
he had caught a fleeting expression of fear in her eyes—or
fancied it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I to worry me? But that’s the kind of
question a husband or accepted lover would ask. You’ve
whirled too far ahead on your merry-go-round. Get back
to the starting-point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never seem to get beyond it. Will you give me a
kiss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve often kissed you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean a peck. And you’re out of your rôle.
It’s what any man would ask a girl, you know, who had
let herself be persuaded to stay on with him downstairs
at two in the morning. She’d think him a chump if he
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s going rather fast—for some girls. Others
kiss any man any old time. I’m the great exception or
you wouldn’t think I’m the one and only. And I don’t
think I care for that part of the program.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bound to come sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. You talked a lot about wooing but there
was no understanding you were to win—not by a long
sight——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please stay in your rôle. I am begging for a kiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita looked at him reflectively. There wasn’t so much
to kiss between that mustache and beard. She didn’t
altogether like his mouth but she was used to it. And
if it was the thing to do—she moved her head forward;
and then she encountered a disturbing gleam in his half-closed
eyes, and drew back; restraining an impulse to
hiss and flee. She had seen that gleam in men’s eyes
before. Carnalites. Eustace!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same moment she became conscious of a resource
that was offering its timely aid. “Not yet,” she
murmured with soft coquetry. “It’s too soon. Talk to
me for a little while first. Talk to me about yourself,”
she added with inspiration. “Tell me when you first began
to find me attractive. After—later——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned her elbow on the arm of the chair and
covered her eyes with her hand. Eustace, drawing a
long breath, but admiring this astonishing adaptability to
a rôle so foreign to her, leaned back in his chair and
began to talk on a low and vibrating note; expressing
his hopes and fears, his longings and doubts, with considerable
art; for, he told himself, he said not a word
too much nor too little. At the end of ten minutes he
asked her a question. There was no answer. He bent
over her. She was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He refrained from shaking her roughly, but shake her
he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet and yawned in his face. “Oh,
Eustace, how rude of me! But your voice was so soothing
and I was nearly dead with sleep. Hated to be so
impolite as to tell you—we’ll have to continue on page
181 from page 2. Good night, dear Eustace, and forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she slipped by him like a trout under water and
up the stair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> arrived at the manor in time for dinner and spent
the greater part of the night wandering about the house,
which she had ordered to be lit from drawing-room to
attic. She was so glad to be there—and alone—that she
felt no inclination to sleep, and even the haunting terrors
of the past week were banished for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a quite personal species of humor that she
could invoke at will, and a large surface-tract in her mind
upon which she had lived abundantly during the past
year. But, always ruthlessly honest with herself, she
had begun to suspect, even before that remarkably odd
outbreak under the goading of De Witt Turner, that
something had been going on underneath that broad and
fertile surface which it was time for her to tweak to
the light and examine. She had turned from it in terror,
almost in horror, and had permitted herself a respite
until she was alone at her manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on this night of her return she felt only happiness
and content. This was hers, her own domain, memoried,
beautiful, and intensely personal; so personal that she
had at times the impression she had lived in this house
consecutively for two hundred and sixty-three years. It
seemed to return her passionate devotion, to enfold her,
to promise her peace, possibly happiness. She exulted
in every stone of it, and drew her hand lovingly across
the old pieces of furniture, less sensible of their value
than of their intimate association with the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could remain here for the rest of her life if she
chose, denying even Eustace hospitality, and she had
a sense of freedom, of buoyancy, vastly different from the
superficial enjoyments of the past winter in New York.
They had been novel and entrancing, but both novelty
and charm had worn thin; and they had served their
purpose. No woman is complete until she has had her
experience of the lighter pleasures of life; barely conscious
of the depths underneath until frivolities turn into
débris and balance is established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had long suspected that she knew a good deal more
than she admitted to herself, both apart from her personal
ego and inextricably entangled with it, and it was
time to find out what it was. She was uneasy, frightened,
but determined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, in a day or two she would take the lid off, but
tonight she would play with the idea that she had lived
her life at the manor and that no serious problems had
ever knocked at her consciousness for solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A storm raged during the night and showed no sign
of abatement next morning. She put on a raincoat and
stout boots and went over to the deserted Boardwalk.
The chain of shops looked like an abandoned village.
But the waves thundered in almost to the high promenade,
and she took a fierce pleasure in battling with the
wind, clinging only occasionally to the rail. She felt as
if she were charging an elemental enemy and chose to
take it as a portent, that although she might for a moment
be forced to clutch at something stronger than herself,
she could neither be blown over nor forced to retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night she slept twelve hours, and when the broad
sunlight awakened her, her brain was as clear as the sky
and she knew that her respite was over; or would be
when the day itself was over. She had decided that the
night, when she would be free of interruption from even
her docile servants, was the time to “have it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper had received instructions to admit no one and
to bring her no telephone messages. Eustace had promised
not to return to the manor before Friday, nor attempt
to communicate with her. Her isolation was complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast she took a long walk on the hard roads,
and spent the afternoon answering an accumulation of
letters from her California friends. Ann Melrose had
spent the winter in New York and written home reports
both astonishing and amusing; the result had been a
revival of correspondence with the girl they had “given
up as a bad job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the hands of the clock, made for the first American
Carteret, in Connecticut—a province that would seem
to have been so completely occupied during the seventeenth
century building historic furniture for twentieth-century
collectors the wonder is it found time for the
making of Puritanical history—moved relentlessly on, and
at nine o’clock the house was as silent as the vault in the
churchyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the day she had brought down from the attic
the gown of gold tissue she had worn the night of the
party, and she went up to her bedroom and put it on.
The wigs had been returned, but she powdered her hair
and even put a patch on her cheek. She had a whimsical
idea that in capturing the outward semblance of the old
Gita Carterets she would banish the last of those inhibitions
which had made her so different not only from them
but from all other girls, and, with her saner knowledge
of life, help her to that exact understanding of herself
she had fancied she possessed in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She locked the doors of the drawing-room, lit several
candles, and established herself in one of the few comfortable
chairs a century, singularly indifferent to comfort,
had produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” she said aloud, “off with the lid.” And she
routed a last moment of shrinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature had endowed her superlatively, and a neurosis,
inevitable in a sensitive aspiring fastidious girl, had given
her a rabid hatred of a sex designed, among other purposes,
to complete her own. Her abhorrence of sex in all
its manifestations had been, in a measure, a subtle protest
against thwarted romance: an invention of the Teutonic-Nordics,
to be sure, but none the less potent when rubbed
in by the centuries. Nor had modernism killed it. Realists
were not so much realists from reaction or conviction
as from resentment at their own inability to realize it.
They were in the same class with radicals who hated a
society in which they were incapacitated by natural equipment
to achieve success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life, literature, nor history would be sufferable without
the glamour of romance, however personally immiscible.
The invention and constant use of the word “love”
was proof of that. Mere decency ordained that a certain
enchantment be shed over a function as native as hunger,
where personal selection, imposed by civilization, was
concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, she accepted the fact. Also the fact that what
her three friends called a sound endocrine constitution
had saved her from becoming one of those semi-outlaws so
freely discussed in her new circle. That was a phase
she had no desire to dwell on, but she faced it squarely.
Such women, she had been told, had sometimes the most
idealized relationships, a mental and spiritual harmony
seldom found with men; being rarely fools. Through
this ominous lack of balance in the ductless glands and
an arbitrary gift from Nature of cells which had no
legitimate place in their anatomy, they were not only
enabled but compelled to love their own sex; and as
faithfully, protectively, and self-sacrificingly, as those that
were fitted with normal response to man. Often more
so. They were by no means mere sensualists. Nature
here was as inexorable as elsewhere and she had not
waited upon the decadence of civilizations to develop the
type. It had existed since the dawn of history. No doubt
since the dawn of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Nature’s purpose was no man could guess. But
that she had a purpose, methodical creature that she was,
no intelligent man could doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had passed over one Gita Carteret, even refusing
to unbalance those cells, with everything working
in her favor. The result was that Gita Carteret had been
isolated high and dry. A rock in mid-ocean. A capacity
for agreeable friendships, but about as emotional as an
unhatched egg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, that was that. She’d never think of it again if she
could avoid it. But insularity had its compensations!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt as if something resistant in her brain were
straining and creaking as she swung it ruthlessly to that
strange moment when De Witt Turner’s words—uttered
more or less at random—had turned her mind into a
cauldron. But that frenzied moment had not only been a
revelation but a deliverance. She had experienced a sensation
of exhaustion when it was over, during which she felt
that something had exploded, then taken wing. That such
an access of hatred for a side of life still unexplored
would never come again. She had been delivered—and
for what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for Eustace Bylant. Her recoil from that gleam
in his eyes when he bent forward to kiss her was conclusive.
No need to be asexual to be revolted at the
thought of kissing a man she did not love and never
could love. Even his light and frequent touch, of which
she had barely been conscious as long as the lid was
down, would be unendurable hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He “loved” her, of course. Always had. She had kept
the lid down with a vengeance! She must have known
from the first that he was in love with her in the orthodox
male fashion—known it down in that, automatically recording
invisible register; but that censored mind of hers
had turned its back blithely; kept its conscious part suspended
in that rarefied ether she had chosen as her habitat,
peopled with queer eidola of her human acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too bad! It would have been the ideal solution to love
Eustace, who had so much to offer, with whom she could
live her life in a companionship found by few women
with the men of their choice. But she did not. She
almost hated him. He must never return here. She’d
write and tell him so at once. If he hadn’t loved her
she’d be willing to go on. But she had had one of her
illuminating flashes. She knew he had reached the limit
of his endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had no intention of making him ridiculous.
She had liked him too well for that, owed him too much.
They could give out they were starting for Europe or
South America—which he often talked of visiting—and
he could travel while she lived in secrecy at the manor.
The manor was her best friend. A friend, it seemed to
her, and not only last night, that had schooled and
soothed and strengthened her for centuries. A part of
her. Even the blood that had come down to her had
stained its boards. There had been a duel out there in
the hall. And, in another century, an unbridled Carteret,
who loved the wife of his guest, had been stabbed in his
bedroom—the one her imperturbable grandmother had
chosen for her own.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Eustace! What irony! Years of seeking for the
one woman who exteriorized his secret fixation, to find
her only to learn that the shell had deluded him, that
there was nothing within it for him. Worse. To train
her, to wear down her defenses, to deliver her from her
accumulated obliquities, for another man. What was the
matter with life? Controlled it would seem, not by a
Beneficent Power, but by what Poe had called the Imp
of the Perverse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only thing she hated to give up was Bladina’s
pearls!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Brittany set. But no doubt she could buy
that from Eustace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told herself harshly that she was twisting and
turning from that final probing, and after a moment of
real terror, in which she felt an impulse to flee from
the room, tearing off that whispering old gown as she
ran, she set her teeth and went to the brink and peered
down once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in love with Geoffrey Pelham. She said the
words aloud to steady her nerves with their finality.
Then shrugged her shoulders and settled back in her
chair, although she kicked a stool across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, what did it mean? What was she to do about it?
He had been obsessing her conscious mind since the night
at the Pleydens’, possibly her unconscious since they had
sat together in this room. Now that she had hauled him
out into the light he would probably obsess every waking
moment and haunt her dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt that no caged eagle could be more resentful
than she at this moment. Her pride had been as abnormal
as her existence. Her ego could hardly have been
more extended if she had been a heroin addict. That old
dream of herself, solitary on a solitary peak had been
more than an escape-fulfillment; it had been a reveling of
the ego in its complete independence. And there was no
independence in the surrender of one’s ego to another,
even in this latter-day pretense of fifty-fifty. Women
were exactly the same fundamentally as they had always
been. Their instinct was surrender—blind instinct of the
race to survive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she hadn’t got as far as that yet! If loathing had
been exorcised in that final explosion under that detestable
novelist’s goading, and she had been ejected out
of the fog into a dazzle of light—mercifully blinded for
the moment to the fact of Geoffrey Pelham—she was
conscious of no sexual discomfort. She had never discussed
that subject with anyone, but modernists in fiction
were remarkably frank, and while they deadened the
imagination of the reader, they left little to be learned
by mere experience. She knew all about it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although her blood traveled its accustomed gait,
she knew that Geoffrey Pelham’s image was sunken deep
in that unpicturesque pump of hers called heart, and
probably forever. She was not the woman to be able
to love twice. She recalled the definition of love he had
given to Polly, and concluded it was more likely to be
correct than anything heretofore advanced. Science was
explaining one mystery after another, psychical as well
as physical, and she for one liked to know what was
the matter with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She analyzed her sensations toward this man who had
torn her old theories about herself up by the roots. Eustace
had once told her that analysis was fatal to love,
but that was an old delusion that surprised her in a man
uncommonly clear and precise of vision. She felt exactly
the same whether she analyzed or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly had said she felt thrills, turned hot and cold,
lost her breath. Well, so far, she had felt none of that.
But there was a piercing sweetness, moments of intolerable
aspiration, of a desire to wing upward with him
to unimaginable heights, dwelling in spiritual contact with
him forever. Another trick of elemental sex, no doubt,
preliminary to the desire for surrender.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hacking her way through what was left of the fog
she arrived at the conclusion that if she were still insensible
to passion it was because, after her long lethargy,
mortared with violent repulsion, she was dependent for
that upon his physical contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here she would have kicked another stool across
the room had there been one within reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This piercing sweetness was all right, this divine consciousness
that uplifted and exalted her—but did she
want anything more? She doubted it. One indelible lesson
life had taught her: that realities were disillusionizing
and commonplace. Often hard and ugly. Moreover——Yes,
moreover! One inhibition appeared to be still firmly
planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew she could marry Geoffrey if she chose. Eustace
would never stand in her way. He would be bitterly
disappointed, wretched, mortified, angry, but he was not
the man to hold a woman to a hollow alliance. When he
realized that she was inexorable he would wrap himself
up in a mantle of philosophy and retire from the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if she did not marry Geoffrey Pelham, Polly
would. She’d make herself as intimate and necessary as
his coat and button herself round him in some moment
of hopeless depression. After that, of course, he would
love her. No man could help it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She emitted a low growl. Then beat her hands on the
arms of her chair. What did it matter? Why deprive
the poor man of what consolation he could get? He had
given her something Polly could never take from her
(what Polly would be forced to content herself with
was what she herself rejected) and she could continue to
love him and fulfill her soul more completely than if
she entered into prosaic—and hateful—matrimony with
him. No pleasures, when all was said and done, could
equal those of the imagination. She had always despised
stories with happy endings. And shrunk from ultimates.
After flowers weeds. No soil left for imagination or the
psyche. Happy marriages? Oh, yes, plenty of them. She
had even seen several in advanced sophisticate circles,
although they were always informing you they gave each
other complete liberty, and would not shed a tear over
a passing infatuation. Or else worrying if it could last,
and exactly how they would act if it didn’t. Commit
suicide or look round for someone else? But with all
their febrile self-consciousness they were happy enough.
And outside of that limited circle, where people did not
bother about being modern and took life as it came, no
doubt there were thousands of happy marriages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But life had not educated her for happiness of that
sort, however she may have scrambled to the top of her
old pit. She could love, but not in duality. She had found
something very wonderful and precious and inspiring, but
there was only one way to keep it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be jealous of Polly was monstrous, unworthy of
her. She was, of course, but she’d dig it out by the roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what was she to do with her life? She must make
something of it. She wanted no more of society of any
sort. She took no interest—beyond that of any intelligent
person—in politics, and she certainly would associate
herself with nothing that led to being constantly surrounded
by masses of women. She had no artistic gift;
active work in the cause of charity would merely bore
her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It might be amusing to adopt a dozen children.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, that decision could wait. She had enough on
her hands for the present——</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Her</span> excogitations came to a sudden end. The bright
color left her cheeks, and she stood up, rigid, her head
bent forward. The heavy doors were closed but her ears
were very keen. She had heard a light footfall on the
stair. Stealthy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a high courage and had seldom felt fear;
physical fear, at least. But the servants never returned
to this part of the house at night and were in bed and
asleep shortly after nine o’clock. And the house was set
far back from the road. And it must be nearly midnight.
For a moment she lost her breath and shivered. Then she
jerked her head angrily and shook her nerves into order.
Her jewels had been sent to the bank and the pearls were
in the safe. That hiding-place behind the panel in her
grandmother’s room was known only to herself, Topper,
Elsie, Polly, and Eustace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blew out the candles, removed her slippers, and
stole to the door leading into the hall. It opened without
a sound and she hid behind it and peered out through
the crack. The hall was dimly lighted. She saw no one,
but again she heard that light footfall. It stopped as
if in doubt, and she held her breath. Then it moved
toward the library. She heard a door open, close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tiptoed across the hall and up the stairs. Her bedroom
door was open. She had closed it to shut in the
warmth of the fire. She lit the gas and glanced about
swiftly. Nothing, apparently, had been disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie, who was timid, had made her buy a pistol and
keep it in the drawer of the table by her bed. She took
it out, examined it to make sure it was still loaded, then
crept down the stairs and listened at the door of the
library. Soft light steps were pacing up and down. What
on earth could the man want? There was no safe in the
library.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The silver? She stole over to the dining-room.
The silver was locked every night in safes concealed
behind false doors in the lower part of two immense
sideboards. She closed the door and lit the gas. There
was no evidence that the room had been visited since
Topper had put it in order for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned to the library door. The man was still
pacing. He must be after the furniture and was awaiting
the signal of a confederate. She had found little time
for detective stories but she had read a few. And the
furniture in the manor house was worth a small fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung open the door and raised the pistol. “Stick
up your hands!” she commanded, recalling the formula.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was in complete darkness but she saw a
detached shadow move suddenly forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t advance another step,” she cried, and hoped
he would be too startled to perceive that her arm wabbled;
she must be outlined against the faint light of the hall.
“One step more and I’ll fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man made a sudden bolt to the right and then a
rush at her. She fired, and thought the house was crashing
about her ears. But the man came on, and she darted
to the other side of the room, realizing her mistake at
once; she should have retreated to the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s ears were as keen as hers and it was evident
he had been neither hit nor deafened. He came straight
for her, and she could only hope he would trip over some
piece of furniture. She was safe from that danger for
she had arranged the furniture herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dodged behind the center table and fired again,
hoping that if she could not hit that agile shadow
the servants would be roused by the noise. But they
slept in a wing and were cut off from the main house
by massive doors. This time she hardly noticed the
sound, she heard nothing but the man’s heavy breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadow was on the opposite side of the table. She
was about to fire, confident that this time he could not
escape her, when he disappeared. A second later a hand
caught her ankle and she was tripped and thrown flat.
She had the presence of mind to give a violent lurch and
roll behind a chair. But she had no time to rise, for the
man had emerged from under the table and was feeling
about the floor. She still clutched her pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard him rise to his feet and move about uncertainly.
She held her breath, no longer terrified. She
was too angry. The back of the chair was very high.
She dared not raise her head. If he would only come
round the corner. She felt a cold desire to kill, and
would not fire again until he was so close it would be
impossible to miss him. But he was standing still, his
breath coming in short gasps. Then his breathing stopped
altogether, while her own released breath sounded like
a wind in her ears. An instant later he had flung the
chair aside and was upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She managed to struggle to her feet but he had his arm
about her and was groping for the pistol. His hot breath
was on her face and she exerted herself frantically. She
kicked him, and regretted her slippers. She tried to bite
him and was tempted to drop the pistol and use her
free hand to scratch his eyes out. But the pistol was
her only hope, and even in that iron embrace she managed
to duck and writhe and fling herself back. She was
as strong as he was! Not for nothing was she an out-of-doors’
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held her right hand rigidly behind her, twisting
him about as well as herself as he tried to reach her hand.
They revolved in absurd gyrations, breathless, speechless.
Suddenly his hand grasped her right shoulder and tried
to wrench it. She bent down her head and bit him. He
gave a hard gasp, then jerked her still more firmly to
him, put his hand over her face, forcing back her head,
and rained kisses on her neck and throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she had an illusion of paralysis. Not
for an instant had she imagined the man was after anything
but loot. He had come for her! Or was this revenge?
Or a desperate attempt to shock her into submission?
What difference? She knew that her skin was
soft and sweet and the man virile. And she was almost
at his mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was possessed by such a fury of rage as she had
never believed even she could experience. Her exhibition
to De Witt Turner had been but a pale umbra of what
she felt at this moment when her sacred virginity was
threatened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was panting. He took his hand from her
face and she felt his lips approaching her own. She butted
him in the chest with her head, gave a violent wrench
that half freed her, swung round her pistol and fired.
The man dropped without a groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she could not stir, her legs were sinking
under her. Then she staggered to the table, felt for
matches, and lit the lamp. She stood gasping and panting,
not daring to turn her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Courage ebbed back. Something must be done. Police.
Ambulance. Topper. She started to leave the
room. The man groaned, very faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she’d better put a pillow under his head. She
tiptoed back to her fallen assailant, intending to approach
him from behind. The word “malingering” occurred
to her. And no doubt he had a pistol of his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she stopped and screamed twice. The man
lying in his blood was Eustace Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time later she was wondering if she had fainted.
She was sitting on a chair, shaking from head to foot, her
teeth chattering. Hours seemed to pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly her blood resumed its even flow, her limbs
obeyed her will, and suddenly she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! Caveman stuff! Eustace! And he would have
committed hara-kiri before he would have introduced
such a scene into one of his novels. And a rotten psychologist
after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt not the slightest remorse, nor stab of pity.
She would have shot him as deliberately if she had guessed
who he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But something must be done and at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped a pillow under his head and went out to
the room under the stair where the telephone was concealed.
She took down the receiver, but stood in doubt.
He must have a doctor—but whom? Her grandmother’s
old physician had retired. She literally did not know the
name of a doctor in New Jersey. Eustace had one in New
York, for he suffered at times from dyspepsia. But here—what
on earth should she do? She must consult Topper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was starting for the wing, when she turned suddenly
and ran back to the cupboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie! Of course!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was five minutes before she could rouse Central,
who had probably eaten too many chocolates and fallen
asleep. Three more before anyone in the house on States
Avenue could be awakened. But finally a man’s voice
demanded drowsily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it, this time of night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita nearly dropped the receiver. “Dr. Pelham? It
can’t be you! Is it you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice sprang to life. “Is that you, Gi—Mrs. Bylant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Come quickly. Don’t ask any questions. Bring
Elsie. Bring—other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice became cool and alert. “We’ll be there in
about fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita replaced the receiver on its hook. “What luck!
What luck!” But she was trembling once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew nothing of first aid and she felt she never
wanted to look at Eustace again. She hoped she hadn’t
killed him, as she had no desire to be a murderess, even
in self-defense. But the violence of that embrace and
those kisses had turned her heart into granite. She could
feel its weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she was aware of a certain grim humor in
the situation. Her would-be defiler was her legal husband!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked up and down the hall until she heard a
car racing up the avenue. She unbarred and unlocked
the door. As she opened it Dr. Pelham and Elsie sprang
out of the car and ran up the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve shot Eustace,” she announced briefly. “Thought
he was a burglar. He’s in the library.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham, bag in hand, went swiftly down the hall
without a look at Gita. He was a surgeon on his way
to a serious case, nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie grasped Gita’s hand and stared at her. Her face
was white and quivering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Gita defiantly. “Couldn’t see who it was
in the dark. Didn’t expect him till Friday.” Never would
she breathe a word of that horrible scene to anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand the girls walked reluctantly to the library.
Dr. Pelham had cut out the arm of Bylant’s coat
and shirt and was packing the wound with sterilized
gauze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he dead?” gasped Elsie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Wounded in the shoulder, luckily. Is there a
strong man about the place? We must get him upstairs
to his room. Elsie, telephone for a nurse.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Eustace</span> had been carried upstairs. The nurse had
arrived. Dr. Pelham was extracting the bullet on a
hastily devised operating-table. The two girls sat before
the fire Topper had made in the library, silent, after
Elsie had explained that her brother had driven down to
Atlantic City the day before on his monthly week-end
visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident that Gita intended to make no confidences,
and Elsie could only guess what had happened.
She herself had almost fainted when she saw Eustace
lying there, helpless, unconscious, looking as if every
drop of blood in his body had run out. She wondered
impotently at the perversity of Fate. For the first time
she admitted to herself that she loved him. Loyalty to
Gita and to herself had kept that knowledge safely locked
in a remote inner cell of her brain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She believed that
if he had never met Gita Carteret she could have won
him. He had admired her and sought her out whenever
they had happened to meet. When he had visited Atlantic
City he had called on her. She had given up too easily,
but at that time she had been infatuated with Gita and
felt a white passion of desire to serve her and help her
to happiness: after the girl’s long wretched experience.
She had cheerfully sacrificed herself, had, indeed, not
given her own claims a thought. No doubt there had
been also a desire to serve him. And for this! She
knew from Gita’s cold disdainful face that he had played
his last desperate card and lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked abruptly: “Will you tell me why you are
wearing that gown—powdered your hair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita jumped as if Elsie had flung something at her more
solid than words. “Good heavens! I had forgotten all
about it.” The color flooded her face and she turned her
head aside. “I had a fancy—a notion——If you don’t
mind I think I’ll not explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie made no reply and called on her imagination.
But well as she believed she knew Gita she could think
of nothing that may have possessed her to dress up as her
great-great-grandmother with herself as sole audience.
Merely a whim, no doubt. Heaven knew she was full of
whims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, pale once more, turned and looked at her. “You
are very angry with me,” she said. “Wouldn’t you have
shot a man yourself if you’d found him prowling about
your house at midnight in pitch-dark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you could have helped knowing it
was Eustace. Surely he must have spoken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I didn’t and he didn’t, and that’s all there is to
it.” Her eyes hardened. “You look at me as if you
hated me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie shrugged her shoulders. “Eustace is a great man,
and if he dies American literature will be the poorer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be a great writer, but he is not a great man.
Some difference. I don’t know that I’d even call him a
great writer. That helpless adjective has been so bandied
about it’s a wonder there’s any meaning left in it. He’s
brilliant, distinguished, subtle, penetrating, and a stylist,
but no writer of fiction can be great without drama, and
he has no sense of drama at all. There’s not a great
moment in one of his books——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, for God’s sake don’t dissect the poor man’s books
when he may be lying dead upstairs!” And then she
added irresistibly: “<span class='it'>We</span> think him great, and perhaps
are better able to judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita laughed. “I know you think you are! Sophisticated
Reputation Factory. Quite a going concern. Still—not
for a moment am I assuming that Eustace Bylant
couldn’t have got on by himself. He has indisputable
talent and intellect. But not genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a great psychologist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s lips twisted. “His psychology has a few holes
in it. I’m not as incapable of judging as you think. And
at least I think for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unseemly quarrel was interrupted by the entrance
of Dr. Pelham. Elsie sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right for the present. But his shoulder is badly
shattered. I’ve given him an opiate and he’ll sleep for
several hours. I’ll be over in the morning and bring a
second nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had risen also. “Come over to the dining-room,”
she said. “I’ve told Topper to make coffee and sandwiches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw that he was staring at her—that dress—her
powdered hair—why on earth hadn’t she had her wits
about her and changed before they came? “You’ll excuse
me,” she muttered. “I’m terribly bowled over.
Topper will look after you—I can’t thank you
enough——” And she fairly ran out of the room and up
the stair. They heard a door slam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it all mean?” asked Pelham. It was the
first time he had thought of anything but his patient’s
welfare, and he turned to Elsie with a puzzled frown,
speculation dawning in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you guess?” asked his sister shortly. “Well,
if you can’t I’ll not tell you. If you don’t want that
coffee, let’s go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you’ll stay—with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll not. I’m not sure I’ll ever enter this house
again. Please come. I’ll make coffee for you at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with his brows still drawn and his mind racing
he followed his sister out of the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> blinked at the sunlight in astonishment. She had
believed she was in for another wakeful night; and she
remembered nothing but tearing off her clothes and flinging
herself into bed—not caring if she never brushed her
teeth again, nor washed her face. She must have fallen
asleep at once!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She preferred not to think at present, and there was
safety in routine. She put on her dressing-gown and
went down the hall to one of the two bathrooms the manor
house boasted. Very ugly and unluxurious bathrooms,
installed in the nineteenth century. After a cold shower
her brain felt disconcertingly clear, but she hummed a
tune and rubbed herself into a glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she left the bathroom she met the nurse in the
hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is the patient?” she asked politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His shoulder is very painful. I’ve just telephoned to
Dr. Pelham, asking if I shall give him another opiate——I
couldn’t take the responsibility of letting you see him,”
she added hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course not. What time do you expect Dr.
Pelham?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll come at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita nodded and went into her bedroom and dressed
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was aware that she had slept off her cold fury, and
felt something like sympathy for Eustace, disabled, and
suffering, no doubt, as much in mind as in body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Probably a man did have a grain of excuse when he loved
a woman and despaired of winning her with charm and
good manners. Lost his head, poor wretch .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brain
hopelessly confused by fumes of passion and all that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
tumbled out of hard-won psychological differentiations
straight into generalities. Passion must awaken passion;
all that old tosh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He must feel like a fool—worse
than failure, for Eustace Bylant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She did feel sorry
for him, for she had admired him prodigiously, and loved
him in a way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was devoutly thankful she hadn’t killed him. He’d
live to write more books—perhaps better ones. Might
get some drama into them after that seismic upheaval inside
him that must have astonished him as much as herself.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Might even marry again, although he’d done
well enough as a bachelor. She doubted if he cared
deeply about domestic routine. He’d had his grand passion—like
Lee Clavering over that strange Countess Zattiany
she’d heard so much about. Doubtful if Clavering
would have written a really great play if Zattiany hadn’t
shocked him out of his pleasant pastures into a tropical
jungle. He might be dour to look at and none too expansive
socially, but it was evident his imagination worked
at white heat, and no doubt he was grateful whether he
admitted it or not. Eustace would live to be grateful to
<span class='it'>her</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all events one thing hadn’t happened. She remembered
that sometime last night she had experienced a
fleeting fear that that horrible episode would destroy all
she had learned—recall all she had banished—during this
past auriferous year, and she would be as hard and hating
and handicapped as when she had just escaped from her
old life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. destroy all power of appreciation and enjoyment,
all her new adaptability, all interest in the
future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all experience counted, apparently. She would
always think of last night with a shudder, but at least it
had not revived her old abhorrence of men because one
man had mauled her—as other men had tried to, sometimes
had done, in the past. A second neurosis might be
worse than the first. No doubt her sense of justice, of
proportion, developing unconsciously, had balanced her
unalterably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put on a dark blue skirt and sweater, automatically
rejecting the bright colors she preferred, and even powdered
her face to subdue her own color. Noblesse oblige!
And if she didn’t feel hard she certainly felt severely
practical as she went down to meet Dr. Pelham. Romance
had toppled over the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her keenly as he entered and asked professionally:
“I hope you got a little sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disgraceful, but I did. Reaction, no doubt. Where’s
Elsie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered evasively. “She’s rather tired. No doubt
she’ll be over later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s angry with me because she thinks I shot Eustace
on purpose. I never knew Elsie to be unreasonable before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I’m sure she can’t think that! But she’s very
sensitive under that calm exterior, and she had a bad
shock last night. I suppose you haven’t seen my patient?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nurse said I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must get some sleep as the other nurse can’t be
here before night. Perhaps you’ll sit with him for a few
hours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned pale, but answered steadily: “Certainly,
if you think he can stand having me near him. He
probably knows it was I who shot him—might feel a
trifle nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham smiled for the first time. “I’ll put him
to sleep again.” And he nodded and ran up the stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita wandered about the garden until he came down,
but she thought neither of him nor of Eustace, but of
Elsie. She must win her back. Life would be unendurable
without Elsie. Of course she was in love with
Eustace. Well, here was her chance. She could stay here,
and read to him when he was better, correct his proofs,
take his dictation if he felt inspired to write a story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Ideal marriage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why had he been so blind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Idiots, all of us.” And she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham emerged from the house and joined her.
She wished she were actress enough to feign wifely anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he?” she asked, and knew that her tones were
flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well enough, so far. There’s always danger of infection,
in spite of every precaution. I shall watch him,
of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll stay on, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. He’s my patient, to say nothing of old
friendship. I have a vacation due me, and I’ll take it
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both as emotional as the garden slugs, regarding
each other as if their slender past were obliterated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Elsie to come along and not be a fool,” she said.
“She’d be a brute to leave me alone. I don’t want to sit
there all by myself, eaten up with remorse, and if you’ve
put him to sleep we can talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes, which had been almost blank, became keen
once more. He opened his mouth as if to ask an irresistible
question, then turned on his heel and was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Eustace had arrived with his luggage on the day
after the wedding, Gita, anxious to make every amend for
her thoughtlessness, had given him the state bedroom,
Mrs. Carteret’s. One of the baths had been installed in
the dressing-room and he had that side of the house to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although she had entered this room many times since
her grandmother’s death she had always avoided glancing
at the bed, fearing her lively imagination would project
a vision of the old lady, high on her pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood for a moment beside the bed after she had
dismissed the nurse, wondering if she would always see
Eustace there in the future. What a contrast! Her
grandmother had looked a hundred. Eustace, the blood
drained out of his face, narrowing his contours, looked
years younger than his age. Almost a youth, in spite of
his beard. Pathetic. No doubt, if she loved him she
would be yearning over him with those maternal sensations
authors of fiction were always reminding the reader—who
should know the lesson by heart—surged up in
every woman as soon as she fell in love. Well, she didn’t
feel maternal a bit, but she certainly felt sorry for him.
Elsie could do the maternalizing. Why didn’t she come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elsie had telephoned to Polly, who was with her
at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want Geoff to marry you,” she was saying.
“I don’t mind telling you that. But Gita shan’t have him.
I’d rather see him dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita?” Polly, who was sitting on the desk in the
study swinging her feet, thrilled by the tragic tale of
which Elsie had given her a bare hint on the telephone,
almost fell off. She had responded to the urgent summons
because she knew that Geoffrey was in Atlantic
City, but although she had listened agape to the recital,
she had merely assumed that Elsie was giving her an inside
seat; certainly her due. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s in love with him and he with her. I’ve known
it for some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then mother was right,” muttered Polly, and although
she rarely risked cutting lines on her lovely forehead, she
frowned until her eyebrows met. “But it’s hard to believe
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s only recently waked up to the fact—I can’t say
just when—I’ve felt it in the air. He’s been interested
from the first; that’s the reason he stayed away from her
in town. I’ve seen a good deal of him this last winter—stayed
with him, you remember. I soon discovered she
was haunting him; and something must have happened
the night of your mother’s party, for I took lunch with
him next day and he was as nervous as a cat and wouldn’t
let me mention Gita’s name——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know!” And Polly repeated the shrewd observations
of her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are! I don’t propose to have my brother’s
life ruined. I don’t know what Eustace will do after
this. I should think he’d never want to see her again,
but possibly he may be more infatuated with her than
ever, go on trying to win her. Fiction-writers are the complete
morons where their own love-affairs are concerned.
But he <span class='it'>might</span> consent to divorce her, and then Geoffrey
would see no further reason for standing aside. That is
if he could still love a woman who tried to murder her
husband—but when men are mad about a woman’s black
eyes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you surely don’t think Gita knew it was Eustace?”
The digression was unpalatable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. She might have run up for her pistol,
thinking it was a burglar, but he must have spoken——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if he went there with the purpose you think—might
have thought it the wisest policy to——I can’t
quite work it out. Didn’t she give you a hint of how it all
happened? Are you sure she ever believed it was a
burglar? May there not have been an interview in which
Eustace lost his head—and the pistol went off accidentally?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d think that a plausible explanation if it were not
that the shooting took place downstairs in the library,
and she’s not the sort to carry a pistol round, even at
night—she hadn’t gone to bed, either. No, she heard him
in the library, went up and got her pistol, then guessed
who it was, saw her chance, and shot him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Polly shook her always reasonable head. “Gita is
no double-dyed movie villainess. I believe her story—and
I’m rather surprised at you.” She looked at Elsie
sharply, and guessed her secret. “It’s not like you, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie sighed, and ran her fingers through her hair as
if its light weight on her head were intolerable. “I don’t
enjoy being hard and suspicious, but I feel as if I never
could forgive her—and I simply can’t go there at present.
But you must. Gita shan’t have Geoffrey! Everything
she wants! It would be a little too much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly stepped down to the floor. “I’ll go. And if it’s
war to the knife, all right. Gita’ll not get him, not while
I’m on the job.” Her eyes were almost black and her
pretty coral mouth was a straight line with sharp corner-depressions.
“Trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geoffrey isn’t the man to think about the wife of his
friend, lying helpless,” Elsie reminded her insistently.
“He’ll turn to you with relief. That’s your chance. Take
it. He must believe—half believe—that Gita did it intentionally;
and he is—ought to be—the sort of man to
be revolted. I wish human nature were more of a chart!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Gita, hearing the door open softly, turned expectantly
and was amazed to see Polly instead of Elsie. She drew
her over into a corner of the room and Polly whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elsie telephoned and of course I came at once. Have
sent for my trunks and I’ll stay till he’s well. She’s got
to a place in her new novel where she doesn’t dare drop
it (Polly concocted this hastily), but she knows you’ll
understand, and will be over before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh? That’s the first clumsy lie I ever heard you get
off. It’s plain Elsie still thinks I tried to kill Eustace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if she does? What does it matter? She’ll get
over it—ought to be rather grateful to you—have my
suspicions——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it was plain enough last night. Poor Elsie! Well,
I’ll give her every chance. But I can’t think why she
doubts my word.” And her lip, for the first time since
she was a child, quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly, whose affection was not even threatened, for
she guessed shrewdly that Gita’s pride and almost fanatical
sense of honor would prompt her to avoid Geoffrey
Pelham and give herself a clear field, patted her hand.
“Cheer up. I’ll make her see daylight as soon as she gets
over this attack of temperament. That’s what it amounts
to. She’s every bit as fond of you as I am.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Friendship</span> between men may survive rivalry in love.
Men have stood shoulder to shoulder through the centuries
in the hard business of life, and the need of a
strong abiding affection for one of their own understanding
sex, is rooted in the depths of being and not to be
lightly surrendered. There are instances where the woman
has been sacrificed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is always something artificial in the friendship
of women. It is a harness lightly worn and has a
faint suggestion of carnival about it. Flowers must bedeck
the harness, flowers of propinquity, common interests,
ambitions, tastes, mutualities of all kinds in their
particular sphere. Above all, a dissimilar taste in men.
Nature designed them for one purpose only, to carry on
the race and guard it in childhood, and if Mind today
laughs at her ingenuous plan, she has her subtle revenges.
When the flowers wither the harness falls off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie realized this with a sigh. She knew that she had
a certain nobility of character and lofty ideals, and had
believed they would survive any test. But they seemed
to have staggered under the first hard blow, and cowered
aside before a healthy desire for vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had nearly killed the man she loved and she should
not have her almost equally beloved brother. She told
herself she had idealized that girl; blinded by her novelty
and personality; and now for the first time saw her for
what she was. Her instinct of self-protection was strong
and if she were to retain her self-respect she must not
hate but despise Gita. Better to acknowledge herself a
poor judge of character (when glamoured) than admit
she was incapable of true friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, knowing the latent fierceness and ruthlessness
in Gita’s nature, she felt she was quite honest in
her belief that the shooting had been deliberate; moreover,
that if Gita had never met Geoffrey it would not
have happened.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sooner or later some man was
bound to have demolished that dyke that circumstance
had built between conscious intelligence and sex, and an
unkind Fate had decreed it should be Geoffrey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fine wife for an ambitious hard-working surgeon, always
on the lookout for some new kink in the human
anatomy he could discover and call by his name. When
a woman like that woke up she’d whirl to the other
extreme. Have lovers. Snap her fingers at the world.
Ruin her husband’s life and career. She’d ruined one
man. Quite enough. Even if Eustace accepted his release
and came to herself on the rebound—but she was
in no mood to indulge in day-dreams. Happiness was
not in the air!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of a week what Polly called her attack
of temperament wore itself out, and she conceded unwillingly
that she might possibly have been unjust. Might
have developed an unsuspected capacity for exaggeration.
Her brain had felt as if a hot wind were blowing through
it. When it whispered itself off, particularly after her
brother had given her a bromide and she had enjoyed
one night of unbroken sleep, she blushed a little as she
regarded herself in the mirror, and peered at her fine
brow anxiously. Horrid to have been a mere female.
And Eustace may not have spoken, after all. Hard to
tell what a man would or wouldn’t do when the throttled
beast in him broke loose. She had never seen Gita frightened,
but anyone, even an amazon, might be susceptible
to fear once in her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then her conscience became active. Love Gita again
she never could. That was over. But she could do the
decent thing. Moreover, she was curious to see how
Polly was conducting her campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She telephoned to the manor and told Topper to inform
Mrs. Bylant she would be over at once. She knew
that Geoffrey, mortified at her behavior, had told Gita
she was in bed with a heavy cold, and at least she would
be spared the discomfort of an apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she sighed. She had lost something. She had a
curious feeling of emptiness behind that lofty brow.
Well, life was life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> was sitting on the edge of her bed when Topper
brought Elsie’s message.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her to come up—no, show her into the drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been beating her heels on the floor, frowning at
the window. It was open and voices drifted up from the
garden. They were Polly’s and Geoffrey Pelham’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a trying week! Another “wooing game.”
Polly had “wooed” Geoffrey under her very nose. Exercised
every blandishment in her repertory. Anxious when
her surgeon was anxious. Gay when his brow relaxed.
Sweet, womanly, inexhaustibly and multifariously charming.
A white vamp!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Geoffrey almost clung to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ought to hate her but she didn’t. Odd, but after
all, why should she? Certainly, she couldn’t accuse her
of treachery; Polly knew nothing of her feeling for
Geoffrey. If Mrs. Pleyden had implanted a doubt in
her daughter’s egotistical bosom, she had been given the
opportunity to pluck it out and had succeeded. She had
been sincere enough that day. The lid was still on!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And hadn’t she conclusively renounced Geoffrey Pelham
to Polly that night when she had taken out her
soul and skewered it? Why shouldn’t someone find happiness
in this world if such a thing as happiness really
existed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, what a mess!” She sighed. “Eustace
wants me. Elsie wants Eustace. Polly wants Geoffrey.
Geoffrey wants me. And I? Nothing apparently. I
feel as empty as an old hogshead on a junk-pile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in truth she had never, not even in the old days,
felt so depressed. This cataclysm had literally left nothing
in her life but her manor! Her three friends were
lost irretrievably. To resume any sort of relationship
with Eustace was unthinkable. Polly would drift away,
absorbed in her husband. Elsie had betrayed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt a deep and harsh resentment toward Elsie.
Not for a moment had she believed in the “cold.” That
Elsie should have doubted her cut her to the quick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
For a night, possibly, shocked as she was, and facing
for the first time the fact of her love for the man. But
she should have come to her senses before this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she had loved Elsie more than any of the three,
and the hurt had gone deeper. Well, she loved her no
longer. And she indulged in some bitter musings of
her own on the friendship of women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she felt terribly alone. Stranded. And she had
lost that old boyish independence and hostility to her kind
which had made loneliness far from insupportable. Well,
she must erect another superstructure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly’s laugh floated up, sustained, as it were, on the
deeper notes of her playmate; now quite relieved of
anxiety for his distinguished patient and friend. The
tapping of her heels became a rat-tat-tat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone had knocked at her door. The day nurse
opened it, her face no longer solemn. She was smiling
as one who had a pleasant message to deliver. Gita’s
heart deliquesced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Pelham promised Mr. Bylant he might see you
when he waked up; he’s so much better,” said the nurse.
“He’s just had his broth and is looking forward to your
visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita managed to get to her feet and walk steadily
over to her dressing-table. She brushed her hair, powdered,
and wished that she rouged and used a lip-stick.
She lingered over these superfluities of her toilette as
long as she dared, with that woman standing behind her.
What was she thinking? She had been told the truth,
but did she believe it? Why not? She remembered a
story she had once read of a woman killing an idolized
husband who had returned at night unexpectedly and
been mistaken for a burglar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What did it matter? She rose from her chair and
looked at the nurse much as her grandmother may have
done when her arrogant instinct of caste was uppermost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go out into the garden,” she said. “And
kindly tell Mrs. Brewster, when she arrives, that I’ll be
down presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is no longer possible for any but the disappearing
ladies of the old régime to “sweep by” those they wish
to impress or ignore, for the skirt of the period, short
hair, and a limp or free swinging carriage, have put an
end to such extrinsic aid to importance. But Gita
managed to pass those interested eyes with a cold blankness
that gave the innocent object of her disdain the
feeling she had somehow evaporated, no longer existed.
But she was as sensible as most nurses, and quite used
to human vagaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not stay too long?” she suggested mildly.
“Ten minutes, I should think. He’s not very strong
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita was crossing the hall, apparently afflicted with
deafness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated a moment with her hand on the knob,
her knees shaking a little. What would be his cue?
Well, whatever it was she would take it. Invalids must
be humored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylant was propped up in the bed, very pale and thin,
but he smiled whimsically and put out his hand. She
shook it limply and sank down into a chair by the bed, her
gaze wandering to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was as whimsical as his eyes. “You served
me right, my dear,” he said. “Don’t imagine I’ve held it
against you for a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I didn’t know it was you,” she muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not! And I hope you won’t hesitate to
shoot the next man who breaks into your house. Be
sure it will not be I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita stirred uneasily. But she was relieved that the
interview was not to be pitched in the tragic key. Trust
Eustace to carry anything off!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who should ask to be forgiven,” he continued.
“But I went progressively mad after you left. Do you
remember a book I once gave you to read—‘The Cave
Man Within Us’? Well, the cave man in me got the
best of several centuries of superimpositions. I remember
Darwin says somewhere that man, even in the best
of our poor civilizations, is so close to the incalculable
æons of savagery behind us, the wonder is the veneer remains
on him at all. But I promise you that my veneer
shan’t rub off again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your psychology failed you,” said Gita dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did!” he said smiling. “It did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thrust out her foot and gazed at the toe of her
shoe. She reminded herself she must not excite him
but she would have liked a “show-down” then and there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up. He was looking at her pleadingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t said you forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, of course I forgive you. Forget it and get
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose but he put out his hand and detained her.
“I’d like you to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nurse only gave me ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Elsie telephoned she was coming. She must be
downstairs now. It’s the first time. She thinks I shot
you on purpose. Elsie is a very loyal friend of yours—more
than she is of mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she?” His voice was indifferent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ask her to read to you as soon as you are better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I detest being read to. It makes me nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, tell you all the news, then. You know you’ll
be glad to see her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see you. You’ll come in every day?” His
eyes were entreating but his face was composed. Not
likely he would make a fool of himself twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—of course—as often as you like. I owe you that
much.” And she smiled ruefully. But she gave a deep
inner sigh of relief as the nurse opened the door with a
sprightly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time’s up, Mrs. Bylant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Bylant!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>She</span> found Elsie at the window of the drawing-room
watching her brother and Polly Pleyden, who were retreating
down a path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Elsie. Hope your cold’s better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie turned swiftly and was annoyed to feel her
face flushing. “I’m afraid you think me a brute,” she
stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Gita briskly. “A cold must be a
beastly affliction. Mother used to have them and always
went to bed. Eustace had a horrid one last winter.
Looked horrid, too. Have a cigarette?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks—bad for a cold.” Elsie could not feign
hoarseness, but she was grateful that her face was peaked
and pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita’s eyes were hard and bright. She sat in a high-backed
wing-chair, her head very erect. Her resemblance
to the portrait of her grandmother behind her
smote Elsie; and with a faint sense of amusement but
more of regret, she seated herself opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geoffrey tells me that Eustace is getting on splendidly,”
she said. “I’m so glad to hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother is an admirable surgeon. Lucky for
Eustace he was in Atlantic City that night. Lucky more
ways than one. Averted a scandal, no doubt. I’ve just
seen Eustace, and now that he’s so much better I hope
you’ll give him some of your time. He always enjoyed
talking to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will! As often as he can stand me. But
I suppose he’ll be up and about before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll still need amusing. You wouldn’t like to move
over again? Eustace will probably go abroad later, but
not for quite a while, I should think. He’ll no doubt
prefer to get his strength back here in the country. I’ll
be glad to have you come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie darted a swift glance at the haughty, almost arrogant
figure in the stately chair. What scheme lay behind
that careless invitation that was more like a command?
She fancied she could guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come, of course, if you want me. And I’m glad
Polly was able to be with you this week. She’s not
wasting her time, by the way.” Elsie craned her neck
toward the garden. “You remember I once told you
she had—oddly enough—taken a tremendous fancy to
my brother. I’m wondering if it’s really serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita would not discuss Polly with Elsie. And
she suddenly remembered that Geoffrey’s sister had expressed
intense disapproval of such a marriage. She
ranged herself on Polly’s side instinctively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham appeared at the window. “Why are you
sitting in the house on a day like this?” he asked. “Come
out into the garden. How did you find Eustace, Mrs.
Bylant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you wouldn’t call me Mrs. Bylant. I’m Gita
Carteret to everyone else. He seems all right, and not
a bit tired when I left him. Where’s Polly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just left. Her mother’s car came for her some time
ago as she’s expected for lunch. She asked me to explain,
as she thought you were still upstairs with Eustace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita placed her hands on the low sill of the window
and swung herself out on to the grass. “Coming, Elsie?”
She suppressed an impulse to say “Mrs. Brewster.” “Or
will you go over and get your things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie hesitated. For the first time the eyes of the
two girls met in hostility. No invitation for luncheon
came from Gita although it could not be far from one
o’clock. Elsie was only half-beaten, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll telephone for a taxi, if I may,” she said. “I
don’t feel up to a long walk, and I’d be likely to catch
more cold in a trolley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She strolled with them in the garden until the taxi
arrived, praying it would be late and Gita, in common
decency, be compelled to ask her to remain for luncheon,
when Topper announced it. She guessed that Polly would
return at the earliest possible moment, but there was
something about Gita that filled her with misgivings.
Even her hair looked wicked. It almost stood up straight.
Two hours, at least!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the taxi arrived in less than fifteen minutes. The
absence of traffic laws in Atlantic City—or of enforcement—was
conducive to promptness. She offered to drive
her brother home. He preferred a walk later. There
was no doubt about <span class='it'>his</span> invitation! Elsie went off in
her dingy cab alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>If</span> one were to tabulate truisms no doubt the prickly
wall, towering to the ether, that surrounds the ego, no
matter how close its human relationships, would be
first on the list. Polly had made up her mind to marry
Geoffrey Pelham and felt no misgivings, for life had given
her confidence in herself and her power to charm. For
five years men had admired, loved, pursued her, and
when she wanted a thing it was hers; why not? Nor
was there a rival in the field. If Geoffrey had been captivated
by Gita for a time it was quite patent he had
given her up as a bad job. Who wouldn’t? Both her
mother and Elsie had made a mistake. She hadn’t been
asleep this last week, she had kept a sharp eye on Gita,
missing no change of expression nor inflection. Gita
had prowled about the house for the most part, looking
sullen and anxious. Pelham might have been an automaton
for all the effect he had on her. Gita was not
in love with him, probably never would be in love with
any man, unless remorse drove her back to Eustace;
who would be a greater fool than she took him to be
if he didn’t make the most of his helpless dependence
and the great wrong she had done him. And Geoffrey
was as indifferent to Gita as she to him. Whether he
had discovered he was in love with one Mary Endicott
Pleyden she was not yet sure; but that he lingered longer
and longer at the manor after his visits to Eustace were
concluded, and that he sought her as a matter of course,
and looked care-free and often exhilarated in her society,
was as plain as the nose on her face. And they would
be together in intimate association, for weeks. Her brow
was smooth, the corners of her mouth curled upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had given Geoffrey to Polly with a grand gesture,
convinced on her part that she alone was the obstacle
to the happiness of her friend. In her brief interviews
with her wounded husband’s surgeon the conversation
had been strictly technical. Nor had his cool impersonal
gaze wavered for a second, nor followed her. It was
more likely to follow the enchanting Miss Pleyden. He
had come to his senses. Odd if he hadn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they knew even less of what was going on in
Geoffrey’s mind than they did of each other. Nor had
he the remotest idea of what either of them was up to.
If he had guessed that they were calmly, more or less, arranging
his destiny for him he would have resented it
for a moment and then laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Gita loved him, however collaterally, he had
never had the happiness to suspect; although he had
known that night as they sat opposite in the dim drawing-room,
disguised as their more picturesque ancestors,
he would have attempted to win her if she had been
free—yes, won, in the end, for he had felt that curious
vibration between them. And even after that amazing
assertion of hers at the Pleydens’ he refused to believe
that Polly’s regard for him was anything but bright
friendship spiced with coquetry. He had immense confidence
in himself as a surgeon, but had given too little
time or thought to women for the fostering of conceit.
He was quite unlike the vapid men of her circle—he had
heard or read somewhere that all society men were vapid—and
he amused this brilliant rather metallic little butterfly
for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She certainly amused him, let him down, sent him
back to his work refreshed; and during this last week
she had been as spring-water in a thirsty desert. That
Polly was too proud to reveal a glimpse of her deeper
feelings, or even to betray sentiment until he gave her
her cue, was the last thing that would have occurred
to him. Love alone would have shattered his obtuseness
and his love-stream was flowing turbulently in another
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that first meeting in his mother’s house he had
found himself thinking of Gita at the most unexpected
and inopportune moments. She projected herself abruptly
upon his mental retina when he was sterilizing his instruments
preparatory to an operation, discussing a case
gravely with his chief, taking his brisk morning walk,
relaxing his mind at the play, trying to fall asleep. He
had been profoundly annoyed, but attributed the phenomenon
to her unusual appearance. Those fierce black
eyes and extraordinary eyelashes, that spirited head that
looked as if it were about to lift her shoulders and fly
upward, would probably haunt any man. No doubt she
had a personality as remarkable, although she had said
nothing he could remember, merely asked a good many
questions. But what it might be did not interest him in
the least. He would not care if he never met her again.
His mind that night had been like an inadvertently exposed
plate and the impression it had received would
fade in due course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her unexpected invitation to the Christmas party
arrived he had accepted it in the hope that a second
meeting would lay the ghost. But when he had entered
that great hall lit with pine torches, flaring down on
men and women in white wigs and bygone costumes,
as gorgeous a scene as even that old manor house, famed
for its hospitality in the days of Colonial governors, had
ever witnessed, two centuries seemed to drop out of
life; and as he stood in the shadow, watching the mock-stately
evolutions of the minuet, a fine haze like a golden
cobweb stole over his brain, and he had a quiet conviction
he had been there before and was here again
for some more definite purpose. Earlier, he had half
laughed, half frowned at his reflection in the mirror; but
even then it had seemed to him his transformation was
so complete as to create a doubt if he would be able
to shake off this new personality on the morrow. He
certainly would never cease to wonder that for one
night in his life he had been handsome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The romp that finished the minuet had brought him
out of his hallucination and he had moved forward merely
to find his hostess and do his first duty as a guest. After
that he would look on for a while, enjoying the beauty
of the pageant, and then slip out. There was no place
in such a scene for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had stood staring for a moment at Gita,
hardly knowing what banalities he might be uttering,
again with that iridescent cobweb flung over his brain
and that curious beating of old memories beneath, his
impulse was to flee incontinently. But after a dance
with Miss Pleyden, during which he believed that ridiculous
illusions had fled forever, he had deliberately
sought Gita in the drawing-room, determined to have
done with nonsense forthwith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a practical man in a practical age, a surgeon
with a brilliant future, a man who wanted no woman
in his life to distract him, certainly not the wife of
Eustace Bylant. A surgeon, of all men, should find
nothing romantic in the most resplendent of women. He
had cut too many of them up. They were all made precisely
alike inside and if they varied in texture of skin
and in feature, inches and symmetry, the best of them
could be classified into types and their original purpose
hadn’t deviated by a hair’s breadth. To idealize them
was as nonsensical as to idealize passion and call it
spiritual love. Even what personality they might possess
was due to the balance of hormones in their ductless
glands. Anything further was the result of imitation
and artifice. Women somewhere in the dawn of time
had concocted a set of tricks and some were more skillful
in the use of them than others, some had a more arresting
beauty, some a more powerful magnetism (super-active
generative hormones), but not one of them, unless possessed
of interesting abnormalities, would cut up differently
from the other. They were the vehicles of the
race, nothing more. Cut out the sexual organs of the
most beautiful woman in the world and she would wither
like a rose broken on its stem. Take them out in childhood
and she would be a neuter and semi-imbecile or
worse. There would be no more “soul” in her, no more
ego, nor personality, than in a cadaver on the operating-table.
Sterilize the Graafian follicles with the X-ray,
coincidentally stimulating and proliferating the interstitial
cells, and a faded woman’s beauty would not only be
restored but more likely than not she would possess
a magnetism lacking when the function was divided.
Perhaps develop a higher “spirituality,” soaring mute
aspirations: sublimation of the sex-urge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His scientific mind restored to its balance, he walked
into the drawing-room where Gita sat with the candle-light
playing on her white wig and golden gown, flickering
in the depths of her black eyes, and, without more ado,
fell incurably and uncompromisingly in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterward he wondered how he had managed to confine
himself to an oblique declaration, refrained from
pouring his passion over her in a flood. But he had
clung tenaciously to the thought of Eustace Bylant,
even when she casually announced that she was entering
upon a travesty of marriage. That had filled him with
exultation but left him as little at liberty to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the altar he renounced her, although he felt as if
the world were sinking under him and left him forever
suspended in space. But he looked forward to the sanity
of the morrow, to daylight, to the unpicturesque garb of
his matter-of-fact era. Thankfully he remembered he
was to operate on a woman for cancer at ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He managed to shut Gita out of his thoughts for a
week, and then welcomed her back. And he thought of
her not only as a woman but as a case. He understood
that case thoroughly. He also knew its cure, but
he was helpless even if she loved him and she did not;
although he never doubted he could win her if it were
not for the malignancy of Fate. If her husband were
any man but his best friend!—but like all men’s men
of breeding he had a high and inexorable code.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His outbreak at Mrs. Pleyden’s had been irresistible.
Well, let her know it. Why not? He was entitled to that
much. And he approached her on the night of her party
no more than courtesy demanded, and devoted himself
to Polly, who always diverted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had asked no questions of Elsie that night he had
been summoned to the manor to save Bylant’s life, but
he had thought of little else, arriving at conclusions not
far from the truth. Whether she had recognized Bylant
or believed him to be a felonious intruder, she had defended
not her house from outrage but her body; that
body a peculiar neurosis had made more sacred than
virtue itself. He fancied he could reconstruct the scene!
Eustace had been a brute and a fool and got his just
deserts. As a man he might sympathize with him but
as a scientist he felt only arrogant contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time he knew Gita’s history. What either
she or Polly had not confided in moments of expansion,
Elsie’s keen analytical mind had divined, and she had
found both pleasure and profit in discussing the girl with
her brother. Pelham felt an immense pity, and if a
surgical operation would have cured her he would have
contributed his services as impersonally as when he cut
a neat incision and extracted a poisonous appendix. But
the knife must come out of the blue. It must find its
own way—down through the stagnant waters, and release
the sap underneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He might have been the man to watch it fall if he
had not been compelled to walk down that staircase
beside her holding the candelabra over her head and
feeling as if he were sinking under the weight of the
stone in his breast. If the time were two centuries earlier
he would have snatched her from Eustace at the foot
of the stair and dashed off with her into the darkness.
But illusions had fled. That golden haze had gone whence
it came. Men had become mere travesties of themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although his imagination had shown unexpected activities
he indulged in no longings to mount with Gita into
the empyrean and dwell with her in spiritual contact.
He was a man and he wanted her, comprehensively, exclusively.
And he wanted her because he loved her;
he was suffering from no mere gust of passion. His
scientific balance might be restored, he might converse
with himself as reasonably about the fatal similarities and
prosaic purpose of woman, but he had never denied
(being by no means lacking in observation) that men,
at times, were intensely personal in their selection; and
whether this were due to a sudden alliance between the
generative cells and the unconscious, or eugenic suggestion,
or fetishes, or propinquity, or a pretty face, or a
restless longing for completion, or whatever, the fact
remained that man, sometime during his life, unless
thymo-centric, wanted one woman in particular and moved
heaven and earth to get her. Well, he had come to that
pass, and by what special set of phenomena induced
was a matter of no interest to him. He wished that
codes had never been invented. Certainly that he had
met Gita Carteret before he had known Eustace Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had suffered torments enough during that winter
in New York. Gita and Eustace in that narrow house!
Companions, friends, almost intimates. How could the
man fail to win her? He began with everything in his
favor, and if a man could not convert a friend into a
lover when he lived under the same roof with her he
must be a poor apology for one. And Geoffrey had the
highest admiration for Eustace Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sometimes gone out at night and stood in
front of that narrow house, paralyzed in a sort of nightmare;
then fleeing like a man possessed. Once he collided
with a policeman and had some trouble explaining
himself, for the hour was two and he guessed that his
eyes were as wild as his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on the night after he extracted the bullet from
Bylant’s body he knew that one phase of his torments
had been a waste of nerve-energy. Gita could not have
been more cruelly indifferent if she had wounded a criminal
just out of Sing Sing. And he had received a subtle
message from that golden gown and powdered hair. That
she had been indulging in an orgy of intimate psychology,
his future as well as her own disposed of in rough
outline, he was mercifully ignorant, but that the masquerade
was in some way connected with himself and
the night they had hovered on the verge of an understanding,
he knew as well as if she had told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But on this he dared not dwell. She was still Bylant’s
wife, and Bylant was his patient. He devoted his
skill to saving the man’s life, avoided Gita, and turned
to Polly for distraction. And for all he knew Gita might
really be consumed with remorse; or if undergoing a
profound revulsion of feeling, needed only that first interview
with her prostrate husband to melt into pity and
the determination to atone with a lifetime of friendly
devotion. Not love. If that had been latent it would
have sprung to life in the moment she had turned on
the light and seen him wounded and unconscious at her
feet. But there was small consolation in the thought
that even if Eustace, pursuing his new advantage, called
in the services of an endocrinologist, it would avail him
nothing unless Gita loved him. And Gita was by no
means the type of woman to translate pity into love.
But she might immolate herself, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had walked with Polly during that interview, hardly
knowing whether his answers to her lively sallies were
rational or mere sputterings from an overcharged brain.
She had told him finally he was absent-minded and run
off to her car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he looked in through the window and saw
Gita sitting in that high-backed chair like an image of
arrogant fate he knew that Eustace had lost again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Topper</span> announced luncheon. It was served in the
dining-room, as Gita had taken a dislike to the breakfast-room,
so intimately associated with Eustace and
Elsie; and although she had sat beside Eustace here on
the night of the wedding, their chairs tied together with
a white ribbon, and listened to speeches and toasts, the
only memory that emerged definitely was the white
flounces De Witt Turner had sewed on her dignified
ancestor’s uniform of state. He had looked excruciatingly
funny and she had fastened her mind on those
flounces and refrained from gritting her teeth when toasting
bores were congratulating Eustace and assuming she
was congratulating herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geoffrey Pelham had sat on her side of the table and
she had not seen him again until he bade her good-night.
Then she had been too excited over her beautiful wedding-presents
to give him a parting glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dining-room was high and dark and austere.
Black-browed Carterets in tarnished frames seemed to
look out of the wall itself. But she felt a Carteret among
them, severed the more completely from that brief period
when all but the blessed sophisticates had called her
Mrs. Bylant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Places for two were laid at one end of the long table.
Topper had suggested a small table in front of the fireplace
for herself and Polly, but Gita was in no mood for
compromise. She would sit where her grandmother had
sat alone for so many years, save on the rare occasions
when she had summoned the county to a formal and
depressing function. Otherwise, no doubt, she had sat
with her thoughts for company, her dimming vision
peopling the long lines of chairs with ghosts. No compromise
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper, too, was uncompromising. If he could not
have a symmetrical small table he would not crowd his
beloved silver at one end leaving a long expanse desolate.
Candelabra and massive pieces were arranged with precision
from end to end, and although he felt no inclination
to set places for absent guests, and left all but two
of the paneled chairs against the paneled walls, the
remote curve patronized by this incomprehensible mistress
had never the unseemly effect of being cluttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pelham felt that he had enough to endure without
being asked to eat in a tomb. His mother talked sometimes
of the past glories of her family, whose ancestral
mansion (wooden, painted white, with green blinds) had
been in Massachusetts, but he was thankful he was
descended from the Dedhams on the petticoat side and
had been brought up in a light and airy house in Atlantic
City, however unhistoried and architecturally debased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gita, sitting in her grandmother’s high-backed
wing-chair, looked less like a descendant than an ancestress.
She had been brittle but vivacious during that
half-hour in the garden, but here she looked as if the
mantle of these infernal frowning Carterets had frozen
the blood in her veins. For the moment she once more
interested him as a case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mentioned Eustace for the first time since he had
made his perfunctory inquiry, after her visit. “I was
very much worried for a time—afraid of infection. But
Eustace has the constitution of an ox.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your good doctoring.” And her smile was grimly
gracious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surgeons and nurses can do so much and no more.
He may thank his sturdy Dutch ancestors and the healthy
life he has led.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that shoulder will be permanently stiff,”
he went on impatiently. “Hard on a writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can dictate, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He once told me he couldn’t endure the idea of anyone
in the room with him when he wrote. Jealous, or
something of the sort. Wanted to be alone with his
characters. Authors are afflicted with temperament, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could tap it out with one hand. I’ve noticed
one generally manages to do what one has to do. If not
one way then another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True. I’m glad he’d just finished his novel. By the
time he is ready to begin another——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a good idea for him to travel for a time.
You might suggest it. He’s been talking of a trip to
South America. How soon will he be able to travel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for two or three months yet. Shock must be
taken into consideration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. South America. Good
idea. Interesting country. You would enjoy the trip
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept his eyes on his plate, although the excellent
fried chicken of the excellent cook might have been a
rump steak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no intention of going to South America. I
expect to live in this house for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—rather a monotonous life, that, for a girl of your
age. And rather rash to be so certain of anything,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing rash about me,” muttered Gita. “When I
make up my mind to do a thing I do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pelham cast out another line, thankful for the discretion
of Topper who remained in the room as little
as possible. “I can’t imagine Eustace shut up in an old
manor house in winter. New York owns him, body and
soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be nothing to keep him out of New York.
He’s welcome to stay here as long as he’s an invalid,
but when he goes it will be with the understanding he’s
seen the last of the manor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brief silence and then Geoffrey stammered: “Do
you intend to divorce him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I? What excuse?” And then she burst
into a peal of laughter. The one plea she could advance
was a husband’s wild attempt to enforce his rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mantle fell from her. “Don’t ask me what I was
laughing at! Poor Eustace! If he chooses to divorce
me he can do so on the ground of desertion. We could
meet in Paris. And of course he will want his freedom
in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The precipitations of the past week had suddenly resolved
themselves an hour since into a half-conscious determination
to show Polly her place and Pelham that he
was still hopelessly in her toils. But when she found
herself alone with him in the dining-room she had
anathematized herself as a fool and retreated in stiff
panic from the results of any such exercise of power.
Now she suddenly felt light-hearted once more. Her
intense self-consciousness had fled with her gale of mirth.
Blessed be humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reason they shouldn’t be friends until he went
out of her life altogether. And she realized sharply that
her most crying want this past week had been someone
to talk to, a confidant. She had got used to talking
things out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, threw out a line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad Polly had to desert you today. I’m a poor
substitute. Don’t know exactly how or what I’ve been
feeling this last week. Remorse, I think, for not feeling
remorse. Been as glum as—can’t think of anything
emphatic enough. Felt, rather, as if I’d been stirred
up with a spoon and nothing would settle. Better not
try to diagnose me,” she added hastily. His gaze was
very intense. “Are you and Polly engaged?” She shot
out the question and then dropped her eyes in consternation.
She had had no intention of being direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. Neither I nor Polly has ever thought
of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re as blind as a bat!” She fastened her eyes
on him with her fiercest expression and he felt as if they
had pushed him to the wall and pinned him there. “Of
course she expects you to marry her,” she said with harsh
and bitter emphasis. “So does everybody else. You’d
be a cad if you didn’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pelham gave a violent exclamation and sprang to his
feet, overturning his chair. “How dare you use such a
word to me!” he shouted, his face blazing. “After what
I’ve been through—done—renounced! You little tiger-cat!
I wish to God you were a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt no love for her at that moment. He almost
hated her. He had had words both high and hot with men
who disagreed with him, been abused by unreasonable
patients, but it was the first time the most contemptible
word in the language had been hurled at him, and the
indignity stung him to fury. “Yes, by God! I wish you
were a man. I’d beat you black and blue and rub your
nose in the dirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita had gazed at him fascinated for a moment and
then dropped her eyes. A curious thrill rippled over her
nerves, and she hid her hands under the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take it back,” she said hastily. “You know
how carelessly and exaggeratedly we use words these
days. I only meant that any girl would expect a proposal—after
such devotion——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devotion! She knows I enjoy her society. She
knows I’ve never given anything further a thought—any
more than she has herself. There’s never been a
glance of sentiment between us. She amuses herself with
one man after another. She told me so herself. What—how
could you—after what I told you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, I remember.” She did not raise her eyes.
Geoffrey had not looked so attractive in costume as with
those flaming furious blue eyes—almost black with
temper—exactly like an indignant schoolboy unjustly
accused of raiding an orchard. “Please sit down. I’ve
apologized. You should forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted his chair and dropped into it. “You don’t
deserve to be forgiven,” he growled, although his anger
was ebbing. “But we’ll settle this once for all. If I’ve
made Polly conspicuous there is but one thing for me
to do. I’ll place Eustace in the hands of a local practitioner
and return to New York. As she will spend
the summer here we shall drift apart naturally, and anyone
who has gossiped—if anyone has—will forget it.
There are too many to take my place. But as a matter
of fact I don’t believe anyone has thought of such a
thing but you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I don’t think you should do that—leave Eustace—I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt unaccountably nervous. Cold. There was a
slight tremor in her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was on the point of telling him that Mrs. Pleyden
and Elsie had expressed themselves forcibly, and that
Polly was serious .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that would settle it. But she
could not—or would not. Moreover Topper entered at
the moment. Gone was the desire to show Polly her
place, but Polly had had her chance and lost out. Why
should she sacrifice herself further? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sacrifice? She
frowned down at the unsteady hands in her lap. What
did she feel, anyhow? Damn it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then that zealous little censor she had firmly dethroned
reinstated itself slyly. Why, of course, she
wanted his friendship. She must have a friend. She’d
not make a second mistake and marry one—not she—a
man whose eyes burned like blue rockets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rather
interesting, a friendship with a spice of danger in it.
Her friendship with Eustace had certainly lacked that.
He’d never hung out a danger-signal until that night after
the party when his eyes betrayed that the bottom was
beginning to fall out of his little game. And in him
it was merely revolting. The very thought made her
sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it attracted her uncannily in this man, in spite
of the fact that she had nothing to give him. Well, she’d
have him for a friend if she could manage him. Heaven
knew she needed one. Being a hermit in an old manor
house didn’t really appeal to her at all. No drama in
that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here might be the bridge to something new.
Element of suspense in it, anyhow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who knew?
What, after all, was life but successive links in a chain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Topper had brought in a lemon pie as light as a
soufflé and retired. She looked up and smiled, a hesitating,
curiously girlish smile. Geoffrey’s face was calmer
but his eyes still burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t really go?” she asked pleadingly. “You
know how Eustace depends on you. It might set him
back. And now that you’re no longer worried about him
you’re enjoying your vacation. If it’s all right about
Polly there’s no need to bother. And nobody else will
be here but your sister. Mrs. Pleyden thinks Eustace
wrenched his shoulder and has only telephoned once to
inquire. Topper and the gardener won’t talk. Nor those
nurses, I suppose. The other servants think he slipped
and fell downstairs. And I don’t want a strange doctor
here. And as Elsie’s coming to stay, no doubt Polly
will go home. Do, please, stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no coquetry in her manner, but he looked
at her probingly. There was a new intonation in her
voice and her face had softened curiously. She looked
not unlike a coaxing child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not quite. But his mind
felt a little dazed. She had been so many different kinds
of female since he had seen her, less than an hour ago,
sitting under that portrait of her grandmother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
he was not too bemused to ask pointedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. You see—I haven’t a friend left. I’ll
never even like Eustace again. Polly may not be in
love with you but she takes no interest in me or any
woman when she is concentrating on a man. I’ve barely
seen her except at table since she came here, and then
she’s almost as silent as myself. I’ll never forgive Elsie.
Perhaps you’ve guessed she cares a lot for Eustace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think it possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He should have married her—no doubt will in time.
I’ve asked her to stay here and give him a chance to
find out his mistake. But she failed me when I needed
her most—I’ve been like a lost soul this last week and
would have given everything I possessed for one good
long talk with her. So, you see——” And her eyes so recently
fierce, wicked, arrogant, looked as if pleading to
heaven, and she smiled tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned pale and gave the table a sharp rap with
his fork. The lemon pie was neglected. “You place
me in a beastly position,” he said harshly. “You are
asking for friendship, and—well, Eustace is upstairs,
wounded——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted her head, looking less like a madonna than
a Carteret. “This is my house and he is my very unwilling
guest—unwilling on both sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is still your husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never was my husband.” She saw where this
digression was leading and added hastily: “Not that I
want to hear about anything else. I—well, I suppose
it doesn’t matter if I say it—I suppose I should have
loved you if I could love anyone. But I can’t. That’s
final. Your sister and Polly say I’m asexual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham swore fluently and shamelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s true——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That subject—and all it connotes—may not come
within the province of surgery, but I happen to have
a friend who is a distinguished endocrinologist and psychiatrist,
two sciences which are more dependent on each
other than is generally known. We have discussed the
subject until I know as much about it as he does; and
it happens to interest me profoundly. You are no more
asexual——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am. I want to be. I don’t wish to talk about it.
But if you don’t want to be my friend——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be your friend—God knows I never wanted to
help anyone more—until you and Eustace have put an
end to your marriage farce. Then, by God—oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly’s laugh rang through the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita sprang to her feet. “Go out. Don’t let her come
in here. Tell her I’ve had to go to the kitchen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed her precipitate retreat and caught her by
the arm. “You must——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was cowering away from him. “Let go! Let go!”
she said through her teeth. “I hate being touched.” And
she pressed her hand against her chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his hand but his eyes flashed. “I’d not
do anything you disliked—thought you disliked—for the
world. But tell me when I may have a talk with you
again. How can we be friends if I never see you alone?
Polly and Elsie both here—there’s Elsie’s voice—have
you ever been on the salt marshes at night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Her eyes sparkled. “I’ve always wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll meet you at the manor gates at ten o’clock tonight
and take you for a row. Don’t fail to be there——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened and Polly entered followed by Elsie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gita</span> scowled. Geoffrey ran his hand through his hair
until it stood up like a rooster’s comb. Polly’s eyes glittered.
Elsie set her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned on her heel. “Topper gave us your favorite
lemon pie, Elsie,” she said over her shoulder. “I’m
going to tell Amanda to make another for dinner.” And
she marched off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go and take a look at Eustace.” Geoffrey
made his exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly turned to her ally. “What’s happened?” Her
eyes were more frightened than angry. “They looked as
if he had just kissed her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nonsense, of course. You forget the circumstances——”
Elsie’s eyes turned to the head of the table.
“But something’s happened. That lemon pie hasn’t been
touched. And it’s Amanda’s chef-d’œuvre and the favorite
dessert of both of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose he told her—told her—oh, it can’t
be possible he still cares! Oh, no! I suppose she’d
intrigue and fascinate any man if she took the trouble,
and it looks as if she had. She told me once she was
as vain as a peacock, and she’s become so used to admiration—no
doubt she’s been missing it——” She
grasped Elsie’s arm. “Tell Eustace not to let her go!” she
cried, her voice harsh with fear. “Make him believe he’s
only to hold on, has everything on his side—I forgot!
You want him yourself. I’m out in the cold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elsie was still frowning at the lemon pie. “All that’s
in the future,” she said. “May never come to anything.
But if I could keep him buoyed up until Geoffrey had
no excuse to stay longer——” And then she shook herself
angrily and drew her hand across her brow. “No, I’ll
not do anything sly and detestable. It’s not a pleasant
sensation to despise yourself. We have to live with ourselves—must
keep on good terms. You’re quite equal
to managing your own affairs and you’re on the ground.
You can see to it they’re never alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pelham was heard running lightly down the stair.
The two girls went hastily out into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m off,” he said. “Eustace won’t need me
again today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly moved toward him. “I was going to take you
for a drive to Cape May this afternoon——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I’m sorry. I promised I’d meet a colleague in
the Traymore Book Store at three and take him for a
tramp. He’s only able to get down to Atlantic City for
the day. I’ll be over in the morning. Go up and sit
with Eustace for a few moments, Elsie. He’ll be glad
to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and nodded to Polly, and a moment later
he was striding down the avenue. He had driven his car
from New York but rarely used it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita entered through a door at the end of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amanda has two more lemon pies,” she said encouragingly.
“Intact. She made apple dumplings for the
kitchen table. Bring your things over, Elsie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Topper took them up to my room. Geoff just gave
me permission to sit with Eustace for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid. Go right up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took one look at Polly and then made for the
stair herself. “I’m going to lie down,” she announced
in a high clear voice. “Awfully tired. Don’t sleep well.
Amuse yourself, Polly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gita!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita paused on the landing and clutched the banister.
A show-down? Well—surely Polly must see there was
no excuse for her to stay longer. “Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing.” Polly swung on her heel. An explosion,
and she would have to go. She had no intention
of going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita ran up to her room and locked herself in. She
had never felt less tired. Nor did she want to think.
She could always lose herself in a good novel, and she
had a new one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half an hour later she slipped out of the house and
tramped until it was time to dress for dinner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> dinner was almost gay. Each had her part to
play and each was too clever to play it self-consciously.
By common consent both Bylant and Pelham were ignored,
and they talked of the past winter in New York,
the summer distractions planned in Chelsea (in which
Elsie promised Polly to take part if only for the sake
of copy), and the new spring novels. The last subject
afforded an opportunity to quarrel, which gave them a
welcome release.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel like a movie,” announced Polly, as they left
the dining-room. “Come along, girls. We can all crowd
into my car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go, of course.” Gita bit her lip. “Must do
the decent thing. What time do you suppose you’ll
be back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Round ten, probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you should drive on lonely roads at
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very lonely between here and Atlantic City,
after we get out of that avenue of yours. But if you
don’t want to stay alone—there’s always mah-jongg——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I detest mah-jongg. Run along. I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders as the two girls ran upstairs
to put on their things. She could hear the car,
anyway. Easy enough to hide behind those thickly planted
trees in the avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop at the house and ask Geoff to go with us,”
said Elsie, as the young gardener brought Polly’s roadster
to the door. “Then he can take us to one of the
hotels for supper. Polly says she feels like making a
night of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good idea,” said Gita coolly, and wondered what
excuse Pelham would make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tapped softly on the door of the sick-room. The
nurse whispered that her patient was sleeping soundly,
for the first time without an opiate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That duty done she sat down firmly with her novel;
but after she had read one page four times wondered
why anybody wasted time on fiction, and flung the really
notable effort into a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She resolved not to think and promptly began thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fine performance for her—sneaking out at night to
meet a man and indulge in a semi-romantic episode on
the salt marshes. They’d probably freeze. Better wear
her fur coat. Look like a bear on its hind legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not in the least did she feel like one of those old
Gita Carterets. If they’d ever outraged their sense of
decorum by doing such a thing and risked a cold in
the head—thank heaven she never had colds—hoped Dr.
Pelham wouldn’t sneeze—they’d have done it as a tribute
to capitalized Romance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sake of one more enchanting
memory .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. look back upon when suckling
their first baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubted if they ever felt really romantic. Not enough
imagination, probably. Merely sentimental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, she didn’t feel romantic either. No ultimates
to look forward to, no romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What on earth had possessed him to suggest such a
thing? She could have got rid of Polly somehow and
found plenty of opportunities to talk with him in the
house or garden. Not because he wanted to make love
to her—moonlight—solitude—night—all the rest of it.
Including squawking ducks for chorus. Or was this the
duck season? Or did they have wild ducks in New
Jersey? She’d gone duck-hunting one night in California
and it had been great fun although one got rather stiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She endeavored to concentrate on California. Gorgeous
moonlight nights on the bay. Ferry-boats like
fairy ships, glittering in the dark. Chain of lights “across
the bay,” a necklace for the Queen Calafia Ordoñez
de Montalvo had imagined far back in the centuries
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bare sharp hills. Fog moving in through the Golden
Gate like a ship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. California faded off the map.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just an impulse, probably. Felt he had more to
say and wanted to get it off his chest. No idea of making
love to her; she need have no misgivings. He had a hot
temper but a cold code of honor. Nor would he try
to approach her obliquely. He had none of the subtlety
of Eustace, the diabolic patience, the ability to cloak his
desires and play a “wooing” game, while he watched for
the right moment to strike. His self-control was of a
different sort. Wonderful to break down that self-control,
if things were different and she were different.
But she had her own code.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, if their teeth didn’t chatter it would be something
to remember when she was old. She really wanted
to go more than anything else in the world. Oh, yes,
<span class='it'>wanted</span> to go. Must have her drama—loved beauty, and
the night was heavenly, in spite of the cold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>She</span> changed into a thick skirt and heavy sweater and
discarded the fur coat in favor of a dark warm cape she
had bought the year before to wear when she prowled in
her woods at night. At five minutes to ten she walked
swiftly but alertly down the avenue, feeling less romantic
than conspiratorial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she approached the gates she saw Geoffrey standing
before his car in the full moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful,” she called out. “Polly and Elsie went
to a movie and may be back any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t be home for two hours yet—later probably.
Elsie came in to ask me to go with them and
I made her promise to say I was out. Then Polly came
in and called up two of her admirers and they were
all to meet on the Boardwalk—go to supper after the
movie. Getting into the house without running into
them may be the problem——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left the library window open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stole a glance at him as he sat beside her in
the car. The set grimness had returned to his face and
his eyes looked more gray than blue. No doubt he regretted
proposing anything so ridiculous; also, his conscience
hurt him, probably. Wonder he hadn’t telephoned
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the edge of the broadest expanse of the
salt-water marsh lands. It was as cold and desolate as
the moon that silvered it, and looked as remote from
Atlantic City, blaring and flashing a few miles away, as
if it had swung off into space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geoffrey removed his ulster and locked it with his cap
in the car. He wore a white woolen sweater and an old
pair of corduroy breeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to know these meadows like a map,” he said,
as he rowed with sure strokes through one of the winding
narrow channels. “I’d come here to think out my problems,
and generally at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita drew her cape about her and looked out over the
marsh, sniffing the salt air. A sensation of peace descended
upon her. She loved color and movement and
brilliance, but she also loved cold austere beauty, low
tones, hard outlines, white landscapes in winter. This
marsh was starkly beautiful. Far in the distance was
the black mass of a pine wood. As quiet as death. Only
once a train roared over a bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Pelham. He was smiling; his face was
as boyish as when he had flown into a temper, but charmingly
pleasant. “I shouldn’t have asked you to come,”
he said frankly. “But we’re here, and I’ll leave remorse
for tomorrow. You may tell Eustace if you like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly shall not. I may fly to the moon with a
man if I choose. If he were still in danger I shouldn’t
have come, of course—you wouldn’t have proposed it.
But I came out to enjoy myself and I don’t intend to
split hairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re rather a pagan, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. Seems to me we’re all pagans these days.
Except you. <span class='it'>You’re</span> rather old-fashioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to remain so. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t be
anywhere else. We needn’t talk at all, if you’d rather
not. It is enough for me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You asked me out to ‘have a talk,’ ” she said mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only too ready to listen to anything you may have
to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita had no intention of telling anything. She
had once obeyed an egotistical impulse and the present
mess was the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But something must happen to make the night memorable.
No hope of anything fortuitous. Impossible to
turn over, and be rescued, in these narrow channels.
Not a soul on the meadows but themselves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She
wasn’t cold, after all—rarely was, for that matter. That
fur coat was a wedding-present from Mrs. Pleyden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
well, let her thoughts scatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes met with that quick spontaneous smile of
youth to youth, which may mean all or nothing. If
Geoffrey were experiencing the pangs of unsatisfied love
it was evident he had no intention of betraying himself.
He was a young man indulging in a picturesque hour
with a beautiful girl and it was a part of his part to
be duly appreciative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with that quick involuntary response, that smiling
subtly intimate exchange, she felt a curious stir in her
body. An invisible cloak seemed to envelop her under
that dark ugly cape and turn mere warmth into a glow.
A curious sense of unreality.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Reality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we been here before?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I felt once or twice when we were in fancy
dress? Unfortunately that sort of thing has been scientifically
explained. It means nothing I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather like the idea of reincarnation.” Quite forgetting
she had rejected it with scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I—as a man. But science is uncompromising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Science is always finding out its mistakes. Look at
anthropology. I read a lot of that last year.” She
shied away from any mention of Eustace, even as tutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True. Well, of course, anything is possible. We
know very little after all. Certainly nothing of the
Beyond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I choose to believe,” said Gita clearly and looking
straight at him, “that two hundred years ago I was living
at that manor and you came here from Boston on a visit—political,
probably—and brought letters to us. You
would, of course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I knew it that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very pretty game, if you want to play it.” She
saw his eyes flash and his mouth set, simultaneously.
“But this is not a romantic age, you know. Particularly
since the war. I’m told that no old cliché is so heartily
despised—that’s saying a good deal, isn’t it? Clichés
being anathema in your set, I’m told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That crowd is the merest ripple on the surface. Not
hit in the solar plexus by the war like the young English
writers, but taking their cue, although they’d hate to
admit it. We’re all exactly the same as we always have
been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fundamentally—I suppose we are. But luckily most
of us are forced to live on the surface of our minds, at
high pressure, and seldom have time to take a plunge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seldom, yes. But occasionally?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no reply. She laughed at his frowning brows.
Once more his eyes were almost black. She forced humor
into her own eyes lest he receive a hint of that curious
sensation of something rising in her veins. But her laugh
was infused with that voluptuous warmth bordering on
hysteria by which young girls betray themselves when
indulging in prolonged attacks of giggles. “You really
believe it, you know. One night after a ball, when
our fine clothes were new, you begged me to slip out
and row on these meadows with you, and you had a
Spanish cape over your blue satin coat and white——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are rather unfair, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it.” Her voice rose. “We’re merely
reconstructing the past, not building up any kind of
future. No obstacles in those days, although my irate
papa probably boxed my ears when I got back and
marched you off to the library to ask your intentions——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d hardly have put him to the trouble!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes glowed. “Of course not!” she said softly.
“Of course not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love me?” he asked harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrank back and pulled the hood of her cape over
her face. “You are Geoffrey Dedham asking that, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be damned if I am. What’s come over you? I
thought you were above flirting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am!” Her voice was muffled by more than the
hood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put that hood back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she covered what was still visible of her face
with her hand. “I’m frightened,” she whispered. “Terribly
frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve no intention of touching you. I was a fool or
worse to come out here with you, but it will stop at
that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid of you. You don’t understand, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t—you mustn’t——Oh! <span class='it'>What</span>——”
Gita for the first time since she was an angry child burst
into strangled weeping. He had been resting on his oars.
The boat suddenly shot ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cry it out,” he said grimly. But his voice ended on
an uncontrollable note of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel so strange,” sobbed Gita. “I—I—don’t know
what to think. I never——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, never! Sap rising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” She pushed back
her hood and tried to stab him with her eyes. But they
were full of glittering tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know quite as well as I do. And as soon as
Eustace is well you’ll put it up to him squarely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung her head down on her knees, convulsive
sobs wrenching her body. “I won’t! I won’t! I don’t
want to marry you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you do. You never really wanted anything
before in your life.” He rowed toward the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d hate you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do hate you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. Hate me as much as you like. It
amounts to the same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to tremble violently. “They say—you feel
horribly when you come to after drowning,” she stammered
through her chattering teeth. “I—feel—just like
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. You’re coming to life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a—poetical feeling at all—and I must blow
my nose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do. Have you a handkerchief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have.” She used it. “I wish I’d really
drowned.” Her teeth were still chattering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a submerged—hitherto—part of your ego that
hurts as much as anything else. It’s undergoing birth-pangs
as well as your ill-treated body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate my body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-h-h——” A groan of dismay. “I—I feel deathly
sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie down flat in the boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed precipitately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do feel dreadfully,” she moaned. “And I’ve—never—been—ill
in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk. I’ll give you brandy in a moment. I
brought it along in case of a chill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me it’s in your hip-pocket!” She gasped.
“I couldn’t stand that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s in the pocket of my sweater. You must be
feeling better. Here, sit up and drink this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised herself warily on an elbow and drank the
brandy he had poured into the silver cup of his flask—a
present from a grateful patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell back again, but only for a moment. A swift
wriggling movement and she was sitting erect at her end
of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More beastly materialism,” she muttered. “Why
couldn’t I have come all right by myself?” She stared
at him resentfully, then gave a short laugh like a bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! How romantic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t need romance, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed, laced her fingers, and stared at the bottom
of the boat. Then she looked up at him and smiled.
He caught his breath. A wavering dazed smile, that
passed from her lips and melted in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all over—the resentment,” she said shyly. “And
I’m glad—very glad——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We land in a moment. Can you drive a car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—yes. Pretty well. Polly—and—others—have
taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get into mine. Throw out my ulster and cap. Leave
it at the gates. Take yourself off as fast as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do as I tell you. Leave it in the shade where it won’t
be noticed. Here we are. Jump out.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> she parked the car under an oak she heard Polly’s
swift roadster approaching. She darted into the heavier
shade of the avenue, but that figure in its long dark
cape looked ominous to two girls alone on a deserted
road at night. Polly put on her brakes and brought her
car to a protesting halt. She cried out sharply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there? I—I’ve got an automatic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was in no laughing mood, but she heard herself
giggling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Gita!” exclaimed Elsie. “And that’s Geoffrey’s
car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in for it!” She sighed. “And I’d have given
my immortal soul to be alone tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out into the road. “Yes, it’s I. Been taking
an airing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Geoffrey?” Polly’s voice was high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s his car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been out with him. Don’t deny it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita drew her hood over her face. “Why should I
deny what you’ve no right to ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. Sorry you caught me. Thought you’d
telephoned to two of your heavies and were going to
supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did. But Bob Hillier passed out—how’d you know
I telephoned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gita would not mention Geoffrey’s name. She
turned and walked swiftly up the avenue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Gita Carteret!</span>” Polly’s voice tore by her on a wild
shrieking note. Elemental Polly, at last! Gita set her
lips grimly and sped on. The matter was out of her
hands. She would not discuss it. She wanted nothing
but to be alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Gita Carteret! You’ll pay! You’ll pay!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Menacing, that shriek, no longer hysterical. Gita heard
the roar of the engine behind her and moved hastily to
the extreme edge of the road, glancing over her shoulder.
The headlights swerved and drove toward her. She had
no time even to harbor incredulity. Polly intended to
ride her down!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She darted toward a space between the trees, through
it and into the shrubbery, less terrified than humiliated
at being obliged to run instead of standing up to a fair
fight. But she could not grapple with a frantic roadster
with blinding headlights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car plunged through the opening after her. She
scrambled to the top of a hedge and swung herself over
and fled across the lawn, dropping her hampering cape.
The car crashed through the hedge. She waited until
it was almost upon her, then jumped to one side. She
caught a glimpse of the two girls. Polly’s face was a
whirling disk of white fire. Elsie had flung herself upon
her, trying to wrench her hands from the wheel, but
Gita knew that Polly was nearly as strong as herself.
Elsie took little interest in sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly brought the car about with a wide sweep, picked
Gita out with the headlights and drove toward her once
more. But Gita had got her breath. She dodged behind
an oak on the lawn, ran swiftly to the left and entered
the avenue again between trees too closely planted to
admit even a roadster. Her one chance was to reach
the house before Polly could bring the car about again
and aim for the entrance to the avenue. She reached
the foot of the steps just as Polly made a last wild
attempt to ride her down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita was breathless, but managed to walk up the steps
with her head high. Topper had left his usual faint
light in the hall. She lit several of the brackets. No
more fighting-matches in the dark for her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car had come to a standstill and Gita wondered
vagrantly why Polly hadn’t driven it up the steps and
into the hall, in the fashion of their reckless ancestors
when urging the more picturesque horse. But she heard
nothing for a few moments but the low murmur of
voices. Probably Polly had dropped out of her murderous
obsession with a hard thud and was properly
ashamed. She hoped she’d take herself off, and waited
for the welcome sound of the roadster in the avenue.
To retreat first would be to show a white feather, and
if Polly wanted a scene let her have it. But she was
severely shaken. She knew she had had a narrow escape.
Once more she sighed. How was she to recapture those
last wondrous moments out there on the meadows? Retreat
into a throbbing solitude with this miracle that
had come to her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rapid feet on the steps. They were coming!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly entered first. Her face was no longer blazing
white. It was flushed, but otherwise composed. Elsie
looked distraught, and fell at once into a chair, staring
and gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly’s head was as high as Gita’s. Her tones had
never been more crisp and metallic. “Well!” she said.
“I tried to kill you. No intention of denying it. Almost
wish I had. But once more you’ve won out. Call the
police if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shrugged disdainfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sound of flying feet on the stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter?” demanded the nurse. “How
could you make such a terrible noise under Mr. Bylant’s
window? I only waited to give him an opiate, but he
won’t calm down until he knows what has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita dismissed her with an impatient wave of the
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Pleyden lost control of her car. Nobody is
hurt. Please tell him so at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nurse, her curiosity by no means gratified, retired
from a promising scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned to Polly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really think there is nothing more to say. Don’t
you think we’d all better go to bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly looked at her wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you realize that I tried to kill you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it? You didn’t. Nor do I feel disposed
to lay it up against you. No doubt I’d have
done the same thing in your place. Succeeded, too. If
ever I start out to kill anyone I’ll do it. No anticlimaxes
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly gave a short laugh. “Couldn’t have thought of
anything more cutting! Can feel the knife down on
the bone. Perhaps you are grateful to me. You always
wanted drama. You’ve hit the high spots twice in one
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Melodrama,” corrected Elizabeth Pelham. “But love
and melodrama seem to be synonymous terms—in real
life, at all events. We do it better in fiction. First
Eustace, then you. And both of you belong to the topmost
stratum of civilization!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one is civilized,” snapped Polly. “There’s not
one of us—who’s <span class='it'>alive</span>—who wouldn’t kill to get what
we wanted, if we dared. Well, I dared, and I’m not
feeling ashamed of myself. Not a bit.” She turned to
Gita. “You said out there I had no ‘right.’ I have!
And you know it! He was mine and you deliberately
took him from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never was yours. Nor had he ever the least
idea you cared for him, if that’s any consolation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth did he think? I’ve not looked at
another man for months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you were amusing yourself with a new type.
You told him you amused yourself with one man after
another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably did. Sounds like me. Nothing so blind as
a man who’s in love with another woman. Were you
out with him tonight? I’ve a right to ask that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he make love to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not! How could you think of such a
thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t trust any man. But he’s in love with you and
you with him. Don’t deny it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita gazed over her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Polly turned white and beat her hands together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I must take it lying down! I, who vowed I’d
get him and let nothing stand in my way. I wish to
God I’d killed you!” she burst out passionately, although
the words ended on a sob. “I’d gladly have been hanged
or electrocuted or whatever they do to you in this state.
And now I can’t go at it again. I feel as limp as a
young corpse inside. Can’t even try to scratch your eyes
out. Am the well-brought-up Miss Pleyden once more!
Well—thank God I was something else for five minutes.
I’ll cherish that memory through a long and prosaic life.
Poor things, we moderns. Well, I’m off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated, then went forward and held out her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t ask you to forgive me; but we may as well
be sports.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita shook the cold hand. “Good-by, Polly. I’m
sorry. Wish it could be wiped out. I’ll miss you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Pleyden shrugged her shoulders. “Chapters have
to end sometime. You’ve made one quite interesting
for me! I’ll light a cigarette if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She performed this rite, nodded to Gita and Elsie and
swung lightly down the hall. A moment later they heard
her car traveling at a reasonable pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita turned to Elsie. “<span class='it'>Vale</span>, Polly. But you don’t go.
Not yet. You stay here until Eustace is able to leave.
That’s final.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel lost and deserted myself!” exclaimed Elsie.
“I wish I’d never laid eyes on you. You are a terrible
devastating force, Gita. What will you do to my brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she stared at Gita’s radiant face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t worry! Don’t worry! It won’t be as bad
as you think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, when people are in love!” Elsie’s voice was
more sarcastic than her mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gita swung on her heel and stared out into the moonlight.
“Better go to bed,” she said coldly. “Nothing more
to say, is there?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt herself moving forward, felt an almost uncontrollable
impulse to run out into that moonlight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
recapture that mood so strangely compounded of exaltation
and dismay, triumph and disappointment, poignant
sweetness and futile resentment at the remorseless
incompleteness of life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whirled upon Elsie and, although her words tumbled
out fiercely, a curious quaver of helplessness ran
through them. “Oh, you both have your revenge! I
should think life altogether wonderful tonight and I
almost hate it. It was bad enough to have to break off—to
miss—to have to wait—oh, damn honor! Damn
noblesse oblige! I wish we’d been born in a different
class—like some of your sophisticates—that never heard
of such things—no, I don’t! I only wish things could
have been different—that life didn’t always laugh at
you—that life wasn’t always trying to get the best of
art and generally succeeding——Life could be so wonderful
and it’s just a mean chromo of art and delights
in the fact and in taunting our anticipations—those
lovely works of art we create and hang in the blessed
spaces of the mind—taunting and shattering——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, stop staring at me as if I were a lunatic, and go
to bed. I’ll be all right tomorrow. Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
I’ve <span class='it'>got to be</span>. But at any rate <span class='it'>I</span> won’t go to bed. That
would be a little too much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she hurtled past the startled Elsie and into the
drawing-room and slammed the door behind her.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
